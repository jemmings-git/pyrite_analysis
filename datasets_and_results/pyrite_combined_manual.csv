In east-central and northeastern Alberta the marine sequence is overlain by a paralic and nonmarine sequence having a diachronous contact with the marine sequence.  Distribution: 144.8 m (475 ft) thick in the type well and found throughout the Vermilion area, in Twp. 43 to 57, Rges 1 to 14W4M. It has been used in the area between Edmonton, Athabasca and Lloydminster, Alberta and extended southward to the International Boundary, westward to the disturbed Mesozoic belts of the foothills and eastward into central and southwestern Saskatchewan. The northern limit of the Mannville Group is approximately at the southern edge of the Deep Basin area. Price (1963) defined the probable geographic limits of the Mannville Group, but did not limit its northern extent.  Type Locality: Northwest Mannville 1 well, in Lsd. 1, Sec. 18, Twp. 50, Rge. 8W4M, east-central Alberta, between 558.7 and 703 5 m (1,833 and 2,308 ft).  Locality Data: Thickness(m): Typical 144.8.  Relationship: The Mannville Group underlies the Colorado Group (Joli Fou Formation), with a widespread disconformity separating the two units. The Mannville resides above the post-Paleozoic unconformity.

The lower Miette consists of dark grey to black silty phyllite, phyllitic schist and schist, with interspersed units of light brown to tan quartzite and feldspathic quartzite, and tongues of black carbonaceous micritic limestone. The middle Miette is typified by massive to graded, thick-bedded, feldspathic, turbiditic sandstones and conglomeratic sandstones, with intervening units of grey-green to emerald green phyllite, and lesser black petite map units. A conspicuous triad marker unit of pelite and carbonate. The Old Fort Point Formation divides the middle Miette into three parts. The upper Miette consists of brownish phyllite and slate, with black micritic limestone, calcareous phyllite, sandstone and quartz sandstone. Didymaulichnus miettensis has been reported in the upper 350 m (1148 ft) of the upper Miette in the northeastern part of the McBride map-area.  Distribution: The Miette Group is restricted to the Rocky Mountain belt, where it crops out from Lake Louise, Alberta northwestward to near Prince George, British Columbia. Thicknesses vary considerably, both regionally and locally; the lower Miette is a minimum of about 1,000 m (3,280 ft) (380 m, 1,246 ft of structural thickness is exposed at the reference section), the middle Miette varies from 2,300 to 3,000 m (7,544 to 9,840 ft) (2,785 m, 9,135 ft at the reference section), and the upper Miette varies from 700 to about 1,800 m (2,296 to 5,904 ft) (1,800 m, 5,904 ft of structural thickness at the reference section).  Type Locality: The Cushing Creek area of the McBride (93H) map-sheet, British Columbia has the most complete known section of the Miette Group; it was described in detail by Carey and Simony (1985).  Relationship: The Miette Group belongs to the Windemere Supergroup. The lower Miette strata overlay early Proterozoic basement gneisses along a sheared unconformity on the western edge of the Rocky Mountain belt. The upper part of the middle Miette thins and fines to the east, where it interfingers with slates of the upper Miette. The upper Miette is unconformably (locally with angularity) overlain by the McNaughton Formation. The middle Miette is correlative with the middle and upper Kaza Groups of the Cariboo Mountains to the west of the southern Rocky Mountain trench. The upper Miette is correlative with the black slates and phyllites of the Isaac Formation of the Cariboo Group.  History: Mountjoy (1962) raised Walcott's (1913) Miette Formation to group status within the Windermere Supergroup. Charlesworth et al. (1967) proposed three formation names, only one of which has gained widespread acceptance, the Old Fort Point Formation. Campbell et al., (1973) recognized a three-fold subdivision of the Miette Group in the McBride map-area. The informal units, lower, middle and upper have subsequently gained widespread usage in the literature. McDonough and Simony (1986, 1988a) defined the middle Miette by its distinctive turbiditic grits and intervening green pelites.","list(atts = list(list()), name = ""slate"", prop = 1, lith_id = 82, type = ""metasedimentary"", class = ""metamorphic"")",list(),53.295,-119.074,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Framboids,611.5,618.25,Miette Group,"list(atts = list(list()), name = ""slate"", prop = 1, lith_id = 82, type = ""metasedimentary"", class = ""metamorphic"")",list(),"Lithology: The lower, middle and upper Miette comprise a conformable sequence.

Distribution: The Miette Group is restricted to the Rocky Mountain belt, where it crops out from Lake Louise, Alberta northwestward to near Prince George, British Columbia.

LIU School of Earth Sciences , University of Bristol , Life Sciences Building , 24 Tyndall Avenue , Bristol BS8 1TQ , UK email : alex.liu@bristol.ac.uk ABSTRACT : The mechanisms by which soft-bodied organisms were preserved in late Ediacaran deep-marine environments are revealed by petrographic and geochemical investigation of fossil-bearing surfaces from the Conception and St. John 's groups -LRB- Newfoundland , Canada -RRB- .Framboidal pyrite veneers are documented on fossilbearing horizons at multiple localities .",Framboids,"Age Justification: The Conception Group is presented to be older than the Holyrood Granite of 620 Ma (Krogh et al., 1983) and younger than the Wandsworth Gabbro dated as 762 Ma (Krogh et al., 1983). The Whalesback Gabbro intrudes the Drook Formation. The Whalesback is not observed to cut the Proterozoic III Harbour Main Group and is stratigraphically restricted to the base of the Drook Formation. The Mistaken Point Formation, the youngest of the group, contains numerous fossils near the top of the formation, including a variety of frond-like and disc-like impressions (Anderson and Misra, 1968; Misra, 1969b, 1971; Anderson in King et al., 1974). The Late Proterozoic (Vendian) fossils are comparable to Charniodiscus concentricus Ford (1958) and Cyclomedusa davidi Sprigg, found in the Charnian of Leicestershire, England, and in the Ediacara fauna of Australia, respectively. Type Locality:Rose (1952) did not designate a formal type locality. Williams and King (1979) designated the type area as being in the Trepassey region of the Avalon Peninsula, southeastern Newfoundland (NTS 1 K/11, 12, 14).Distribution:No complete section of the group is exposed and folding and faulting preclude a reliable estimate of thickness. Similar rocks are intercalated with the Proterozoic III Harbour Main Group of the Whitbourne area (NTS 1 N/5) (McCartney, 1967). The estimated thickness is 3,000 to 5,000 m. The group crops out in a 40 to 50 km wide belt, extending between Con-ception Bay (NTS 1 N/11, 15) in the north and Trepassey Bay (NTS 1 K/11) of the south central Avalon Peninsula (King, 1980, Figure 1).Lithology:A turbiditic sequence dominated by green to grey siliceous sandstones and siltstones mainly of volcanic origin. It also includes conglomerate, tuff, agglomerate, tillite, minor mafic pillow lava, mafic dykes, limestone, and orthoquartzite. The group is divided into five formations (Williams and King, 1979), which are, in ascending order, the Mall Bay, Gaskiers, Drook, Briscal, and Mistaken Point.Relationship:The Conception Group overlies the volcanic rocks of the Proterozoic III Harbour Main Group and underlies the Proterozoic III St. John's Group. An angular unconformity at the base of the Conception Group appears to be restricted to the Holyrood area (NTS 1 N/6) (McCartney, 1967, p. 96). The Proterozoic III Gaskiers and Mistaken Point formations have wide re-gional extent and are important in global stratigraphic correlations.

All strata are thin bedded or laminated and graptolitic. In the type area the Duo Lake Formation is divided into two units, a basal, 240 m thick succession of thin bedded limestone and graptolitic shale, and an upper, 76 m thick unit of graptolitic siliceous shale and minor chert. Elsewhere in the Misty Creek Embayment the Duo Lake Formation is up to 415 m thick (Cecile, 1982). In the northeastern Niddery Lake map area the Duo Lake Formation consists of between 125 and 225 m of graptolitic, calcareous shale, shale, siliceous shale, minor dolomitic shale, and minor chert. It has a distinct, conformable contact with the Rabbitkettle Formation that can be placed to within a metre, where a distinct change from limestone-dominated to shale-dominated strata occurs (Cecile, 2000).  Distribution: The Duo Lake Formation is up to 415 m thick and is thickest along the embayment axis. The formation is found over most of the embayment area but is generally missing in Franklin Mountain transition zone and platform facies (Cecile, 1982). The Duo Lake Formation outcrops over the eastern two thirds and the southern part of the northeastern Niddery Lake map area (Cecile, 1997a-d). It is also mapped throughout the Nahanni map area (Gordey and Anderson, 1993) where it is very similar in composition and thickness to the Duo Lake Formation in the type area but has virtually no interbedded limestone (Cecile, 2000).  Type Locality: The type section (Section 6) is in the Misty Creek Embayment at 64°42'N and 130°47'W, 2 km southwest of Goober Lake (64°44'N, 130°45'W), in the Bonnet Plume Lake map area. There the formation, including upper and lower contacts, is well exposed along the sides and crest of a major south trending ridge (Cecile, 1982).  Locality Data: Thickness(m): Maximum 415.  Relationship: Gordey and Anderson (1993) included the Duo Lake Formation within the Road River Group. The Duo Lake Formation overlies the Rabbitkettle Formation conformably. In most places the contact, although defined in scree, is abrupt. The contact with the overlying Steel Formation is sharp and apparently conformable. The Duo Lake Formation is continuous north, northeast and east with Duo Lake Formation strata found in the Misty Creek Embayment. The upper Duo Lake Formation in the study area is also correlative with the Cloudy Formation in the Misty Creek Embayment. The Cloudy Formation is a distinctive succession of basin limestone and shale, that 'shales-out' to the southwest and merges into the northeastern Niddery Lake map area with time-equivalent shaly facies of the Duo Lake Formation. The Duo Lake Formation is laterally correlative and intertongues with the Marmot Formation. The Marmot Formation is a mappable succession of volcanic strata that occurs as a lens within the Duo Lake Formation of the northeastern Niddery Lake map area. To the southwest, the Duo Lake Formation is correlative with, and transitional into chert of the Elmer Formation, and argillite in the lower part of the Steel Formation (Cecile, 2000). In the southwestern embayment the upper Duo Lake Formation is diachronous, almost entirely shale and limestone in the northern embayment. Locally, however, a few metres of sooty grey weathering platy limestone, homotaxial with and lithologically similar to the Cloudy Formation are preserved as a unit at the top of the Duo Lake Formation. Because these rocks cannot be mapped but represent a thin, restricted continuation of Cloudy lithologies they are identified by Cecile (1982) as the Cloudy member of the Duo Lake. The Duo Lake including the Cloudy member in the southwestern embayment is unconformably overlain by the late Early Devonian Natla? Formation. Duo Lake strata are partly correlative with upper Franklin Mountain Formation and transitional Franklin Mountain dolostone (Cecile, 1982).

All strata are thin bedded or laminated and graptolitic. In the type area the Duo Lake Formation is divided into two units, a basal, 240 m thick succession of thin bedded limestone and graptolitic shale, and an upper, 76 m thick unit of graptolitic siliceous shale and minor chert. Elsewhere in the Misty Creek Embayment the Duo Lake Formation is up to 415 m thick (Cecile, 1982). In the northeastern Niddery Lake map area the Duo Lake Formation consists of between 125 and 225 m of graptolitic, calcareous shale, shale, siliceous shale, minor dolomitic shale, and minor chert. It has a distinct, conformable contact with the Rabbitkettle Formation that can be placed to within a metre, where a distinct change from limestone-dominated to shale-dominated strata occurs (Cecile, 2000).  Distribution: The Duo Lake Formation is up to 415 m thick and is thickest along the embayment axis. The formation is found over most of the embayment area but is generally missing in Franklin Mountain transition zone and platform facies (Cecile, 1982). The Duo Lake Formation outcrops over the eastern two thirds and the southern part of the northeastern Niddery Lake map area (Cecile, 1997a-d). It is also mapped throughout the Nahanni map area (Gordey and Anderson, 1993) where it is very similar in composition and thickness to the Duo Lake Formation in the type area but has virtually no interbedded limestone (Cecile, 2000).  Type Locality: The type section (Section 6) is in the Misty Creek Embayment at 64°42'N and 130°47'W, 2 km southwest of Goober Lake (64°44'N, 130°45'W), in the Bonnet Plume Lake map area. There the formation, including upper and lower contacts, is well exposed along the sides and crest of a major south trending ridge (Cecile, 1982).  Locality Data: Thickness(m): Maximum 415.  Relationship: Gordey and Anderson (1993) included the Duo Lake Formation within the Road River Group. The Duo Lake Formation overlies the Rabbitkettle Formation conformably. In most places the contact, although defined in scree, is abrupt. The contact with the overlying Steel Formation is sharp and apparently conformable. The Duo Lake Formation is continuous north, northeast and east with Duo Lake Formation strata found in the Misty Creek Embayment. The upper Duo Lake Formation in the study area is also correlative with the Cloudy Formation in the Misty Creek Embayment. The Cloudy Formation is a distinctive succession of basin limestone and shale, that 'shales-out' to the southwest and merges into the northeastern Niddery Lake map area with time-equivalent shaly facies of the Duo Lake Formation. The Duo Lake Formation is laterally correlative and intertongues with the Marmot Formation. The Marmot Formation is a mappable succession of volcanic strata that occurs as a lens within the Duo Lake Formation of the northeastern Niddery Lake map area. To the southwest, the Duo Lake Formation is correlative with, and transitional into chert of the Elmer Formation, and argillite in the lower part of the Steel Formation (Cecile, 2000). In the southwestern embayment the upper Duo Lake Formation is diachronous, almost entirely shale and limestone in the northern embayment. Locally, however, a few metres of sooty grey weathering platy limestone, homotaxial with and lithologically similar to the Cloudy Formation are preserved as a unit at the top of the Duo Lake Formation. Because these rocks cannot be mapped but represent a thin, restricted continuation of Cloudy lithologies they are identified by Cecile (1982) as the Cloudy member of the Duo Lake. The Duo Lake including the Cloudy member in the southwestern embayment is unconformably overlain by the late Early Devonian Natla? Formation. Duo Lake strata are partly correlative with upper Franklin Mountain Formation and transitional Franklin Mountain dolostone (Cecile, 1982).

Glauconite is abundant and burrowing and fossil debris is common throughout. The formation includes in ascending order the following members: Petrel Member (as redefined by Jansa and Wade, 1975), Red Island Member, Otter Bay Member, Bay Bulls Member, and Fox Harbour Member. The last four are known only from the Jeanne d'Arc Basin (Deptuck et al., 2003). In the Scotian Basin, the Dawson Canyon in its lower part comprises greenish-grey, fine-grained, interbedded, argillaceous siltstones, silty shales, and occasional sandstone beds. The Petrel is predominantly a micro- to cryptocrystalline limestone. The principle lithologies of the other members are: Red Island, mudstone to siltstone; Otter Bay, sandstone to conglomerate; Bay Bulls, mudstone to siltstone; Fox Harbour, sandstone to conglomerate.  Distribution: The formation extends across the Scotian Shelf and the Grand Banks to the East Newfoundland Basin. For example, it is over 600 m thick in the Mobil et al. Hibernia J-34 well (46°43'33.85' N, 48°50'12.98' W) in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin. In the Missisauga H-54 well, the Dawson Canyon is 271 m thick. Elsewhere, thickness varies from more than 500 m in the South Whale Subbasin and on the LaHave Platform, to over 200 m on the Canso Ridge and just over 100 m on the sediment starved outer part of the Sable Subbasin.  Type Locality: In the Shell Mississauga H-54 well, Scotian Shelf.  Locality Data: WELL 300H544430059150; MISSISSAUGA H-54.  Interval(m): From 1017, To 1288.  Relationship: The Dawson Canyon Formation is one of three included in the Gully Group. In ascending order, the formations are: Dawson Canyon, Wyandot, and Banquereau. The contact of the Dawson Canyon with the underlying Lower Cretaceous (Aptian to lower Cenomanian) Logan Canyon Formation is conformable and gradational, except for portions of the LaHave Platform, Canso Ridge, South Whale Subbasin, and South Bank High, where contacts are sharp due to hiati. Throughout most of the Scotian Shelf and on the west side of the Grand Banks, the Dawson Canyon is conformably overlain by the Upper Cretaceous Wyandot Formation. In the Jeanne d'Arc Basin, where the Wyandot is only locally developed, the top of the Fox Harbour Member marks the top of the Dawson Canyon (Deptuck et al., 2003). This coincides with a prominent spike on the gamma-ray log. If there is no spike, the boundary is placed at the Cretaceous-Tertiary contact and would closely approximate with the base of the Tilton and Avondale members of the Tertiary Banquereau Formation.  History: McIver (1972) named this unit the Dawson Canyon Shale and stated that it included a thin persistent calcareous marker. Jansa and Wade (1975) redefined the formation as the Dawson Canyon Formation. They noted that the persistent limestone marker could be correlated with the Petrel limestone, an informal term introduced by Amoco and Imperial (1973) for an approximately 85 m (280 ft) section of marl and chalk in Amoco-Imperial Gannet O-54 well (45°03'54.55' N, 52°38'09.72' W). Precise intervals were not given. Jansa and Wade (1975) formally erected the Petrel Member for the regional limestone marker, but did not designate a type section. Swift et al. (1975) recognized the Petrel limestone in the Amoco-Imperial Heron H-73 well (44°02'26.65' N, 52°25'40.58' W) between 7230 and 7634 ft (2204 and 2327 m). They did not propose a formal status for the Petrel limestone. Deptuck et al. (2003) subdivided the Dawson Canyon Formation in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin into the Petrel Member plus the newly proposed Red Island, Otter Bay, Bay Bulls and Fox Harbour members. Deptuck et al.

Elsewhere, thickness varies from more than 500 m in the South Whale Subbasin and on the LaHave Platform, to over 200 m on the Canso Ridge and just over 100 m on the sediment starved outer part of the Sable Subbasin.  Type Locality: In the Shell Mississauga H-54 well, Scotian Shelf.  Locality Data: WELL 300H544430059150; MISSISSAUGA H-54.  Interval(m): From 1017, To 1288.  Relationship: The Dawson Canyon Formation is one of three included in the Gully Group. In ascending order, the formations are: Dawson Canyon, Wyandot, and Banquereau. The contact of the Dawson Canyon with the underlying Lower Cretaceous (Aptian to lower Cenomanian) Logan Canyon Formation is conformable and gradational, except for portions of the LaHave Platform, Canso Ridge, South Whale Subbasin, and South Bank High, where contacts are sharp due to hiati. Throughout most of the Scotian Shelf and on the west side of the Grand Banks, the Dawson Canyon is conformably overlain by the Upper Cretaceous Wyandot Formation. In the Jeanne d'Arc Basin, where the Wyandot is only locally developed, the top of the Fox Harbour Member marks the top of the Dawson Canyon (Deptuck et al., 2003). This coincides with a prominent spike on the gamma-ray log. If there is no spike, the boundary is placed at the Cretaceous-Tertiary contact and would closely approximate with the base of the Tilton and Avondale members of the Tertiary Banquereau Formation.  History: McIver (1972) named this unit the Dawson Canyon Shale and stated that it included a thin persistent calcareous marker. Jansa and Wade (1975) redefined the formation as the Dawson Canyon Formation. They noted that the persistent limestone marker could be correlated with the Petrel limestone, an informal term introduced by Amoco and Imperial (1973) for an approximately 85 m (280 ft) section of marl and chalk in Amoco-Imperial Gannet O-54 well (45°03'54.55' N, 52°38'09.72' W). Precise intervals were not given. Jansa and Wade (1975) formally erected the Petrel Member for the regional limestone marker, but did not designate a type section. Swift et al. (1975) recognized the Petrel limestone in the Amoco-Imperial Heron H-73 well (44°02'26.65' N, 52°25'40.58' W) between 7230 and 7634 ft (2204 and 2327 m). They did not propose a formal status for the Petrel limestone. Deptuck et al. (2003) subdivided the Dawson Canyon Formation in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin into the Petrel Member plus the newly proposed Red Island, Otter Bay, Bay Bulls and Fox Harbour members. Deptuck et al.

Rarely it is overlain instead by the Ronde Member (Southesk-Cairn buildup; Mackenzie, 1969). In some buildups (e.g., Fairholme-Southesk-Cairn) the Grotto is best developed at the margin and tends to thicken toward the basin and thin into the buildup, being compensated for by lateral change to the Arcs Member into the buildups. In other buildups (e.g., Ancient Wall /Miette), the Grotto Member is more uniform and occurs as a thin horizon right across the buildups. These two different apparent relationships may in part reflect the approaches used by different authors in mapping at buildup margins. Further basinward, in almost all cases the Grotto Member undergoes a rapid facies change into shale of the upper Mount Hawk Formation, and mapping of this facies change is critical in determining the lateral relationships of the Grotto Member.

1079,45663,568340b1cf58f1479a0abbee,5753,Perdrix Formation,37311,348.7334,350.7666,framboidal pyrite,"The first is dispersed throughout the matrix forming a network of either solid bitumen or altered kerogen , or in the Perdrix Formation as elongate stringers -LRB- Fig. 9A -RRB- , sometimes in association with abundant , early diagenetic , framboidal pyrite .",Framboids,"Lithology: The Perdrix Formation is composed of dark grey to black calcareous shale that weathers dark and recessive in outcrop. The upper half to one third of the Perdrix contains nodules or thin nodular beds of dark argillaceous limestone which increase in frequency upwards and laterally toward carbonate buildups of the Fairholme Group. The shales are generally bituminous, with fresh surfaces having a fetid odor. Hopkins (1972) found Perdrix shales in the area of the Ancient Wall and Miette buildups to contain 1 to 6% organic matter, and clays to be illitic in composition. The thin limestone interbeds and nodules consist of argillaceous, micro-sparry lime mudstone, with increasing amounts of skeletal wackestone and packstone near buildups. Brachiopods and pelecypods are present in more carbonate-rich sections, but the only ubiquitous fossils are tentaculitids.  Distribution: The Perdrix Formation is present in basinal sections of the Fairholme Group in the front and main ranges of the Rocky Mountains from the Kakwa Lake area of northeast British Columbia to the Ram River area of Alberta, a distance of 370 km (229 mi). The formation is also recognized in the subsurface immediately adjacent to the mountain front (Belyea, 1958). The Perdrix Formation is thickest adjacent to the buildups of the Fairholme Group, where it contains a higher proportion of carbonate than truly basinal sections. Within the basin sections it also appears to thicken southward. Mountjoy and Mackenzie (1973) record around 80 m (262 ft) at the Ancient Wall. Thicknesses of 110 m (361 ft) are common in basin sections in the Colin Range, while 140 m (460 ft) is more typical in the Brazeau and Cline River areas (McLaren, 1955).  Type Locality: Roche Miette, northeast shoulder, 34 km (21 mi) north-northeast or Jasper, Alberta, along Highway 16. (53 deg 10'N, 117 deg 55'W).  Relationship: The Perdrix Formation overlies the Maligne Formation, or the Flume Formation where the Maligne is absent, with apparent conformity, although paleontologic studies by Maurin and Raasch (1972) suggest that this boundary marks a hiatus. The Mount Hawk Formation overlies the Perdrix Formation conformably. The change is transitional, with the boundary being placed where limestone interbeds become prominent upwards. This transition corresponds to a weathering change, the Perdrix Formation being darker and recessive. Hopkins (1972) reinforced the validity of a formation break at this point with the finding that the Perdrix shales are composed of illite, whereas Mount Hawk shales contain both illite and appreciable amounts of chlorite. In basin sections the formation boundary appears sharp and is denoted by a marked weathering color change on talus covered ridges. Laterally the Perdrix Formation intertongues with most of the Peechee Member and also the upper Cairn Formation of the buildups of the Fairholme Group. The Perdrix Formation is lithostratigraphically the approximate equivalent of the subsurface Duvernay Formation and Majeau Lake Member of the Cooking Lake Formation.

The upper half to one third of the Perdrix contains nodules or thin nodular beds of dark argillaceous limestone which increase in frequency upwards and laterally toward carbonate buildups of the Fairholme Group. The shales are generally bituminous, with fresh surfaces having a fetid odor. Hopkins (1972) found Perdrix shales in the area of the Ancient Wall and Miette buildups to contain 1 to 6% organic matter, and clays to be illitic in composition. The thin limestone interbeds and nodules consist of argillaceous, micro-sparry lime mudstone, with increasing amounts of skeletal wackestone and packstone near buildups. Brachiopods and pelecypods are present in more carbonate-rich sections, but the only ubiquitous fossils are tentaculitids.  Distribution: The Perdrix Formation is present in basinal sections of the Fairholme Group in the front and main ranges of the Rocky Mountains from the Kakwa Lake area of northeast British Columbia to the Ram River area of Alberta, a distance of 370 km (229 mi).

The type section of Raymond (1930) was revised by McLaren (1955), who removed the upper 47.5 m (156 ft) and added it to the Mount Hawk Formation, making the thickness of the Perdrix Formation at Roche Miette 116 m (380 ft).","list(atts = list(list()), name = ""shale"", prop = 1, lith_id = 8, type = ""siliciclastic"", class = ""sedimentary"")","list(class = ""marine"", type = """", name = ""inferred marine"", environ_id = 93)",53.268,-117.594,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Framboids,376.575,379.55,Perdrix Formation,"list(atts = list(list()), name = ""shale"", prop = 1, lith_id = 8, type = ""siliciclastic"", class = ""sedimentary"")","list(class = ""marine"", type = """", name = ""inferred marine"", environ_id = 93)","Lithology: The Perdrix Formation is composed of dark grey to black calcareous shale that weathers dark and recessive in outcrop. The upper half to one third of the Perdrix contains nodules or thin nodular beds of dark argillaceous limestone which increase in frequency upwards and laterally toward carbonate buildups of the Fairholme Group. The shales are generally bituminous, with fresh surfaces having a fetid odor. Hopkins (1972) found Perdrix shales in the area of the Ancient Wall and Miette buildups to contain 1 to 6% organic matter, and clays to be illitic in composition. The thin limestone interbeds and nodules consist of argillaceous, micro-sparry lime mudstone, with increasing amounts of skeletal wackestone and packstone near buildups. Brachiopods and pelecypods are present in more carbonate-rich sections, but the only ubiquitous fossils are tentaculitids.  Distribution: The Perdrix Formation is present in basinal sections of the Fairholme Group in the front and main ranges of the Rocky Mountains from the Kakwa Lake area of northeast British Columbia to the Ram River area of Alberta, a distance of 370 km (229 mi). The formation is also recognized in the subsurface immediately adjacent to the mountain front (Belyea, 1958). The Perdrix Formation is thickest adjacent to the buildups of the Fairholme Group, where it contains a higher proportion of carbonate than truly basinal sections. Within the basin sections it also appears to thicken southward. Mountjoy and Mackenzie (1973) record around 80 m (262 ft) at the Ancient Wall. Thicknesses of 110 m (361 ft) are common in basin sections in the Colin Range, while 140 m (460 ft) is more typical in the Brazeau and Cline River areas (McLaren, 1955).  Type Locality: Roche Miette, northeast shoulder, 34 km (21 mi) north-northeast or Jasper, Alberta, along Highway 16. (53 deg 10'N, 117 deg 55'W).  Relationship: The Perdrix Formation overlies the Maligne Formation, or the Flume Formation where the Maligne is absent, with apparent conformity, although paleontologic studies by Maurin and Raasch (1972) suggest that this boundary marks a hiatus. The Mount Hawk Formation overlies the Perdrix Formation conformably. The change is transitional, with the boundary being placed where limestone interbeds become prominent upwards. This transition corresponds to a weathering change, the Perdrix Formation being darker and recessive. Hopkins (1972) reinforced the validity of a formation break at this point with the finding that the Perdrix shales are composed of illite, whereas Mount Hawk shales contain both illite and appreciable amounts of chlorite. In basin sections the formation boundary appears sharp and is denoted by a marked weathering color change on talus covered ridges. Laterally the Perdrix Formation intertongues with most of the Peechee Member and also the upper Cairn Formation of the buildups of the Fairholme Group. The Perdrix Formation is lithostratigraphically the approximate equivalent of the subsurface Duvernay Formation and Majeau Lake Member of the Cooking Lake Formation.  History: The formation is named from Roche à Perdrix, 10 km (6 mi) northeast of Roche Miette. The type section of Raymond (1930) was revised by McLaren (1955), who removed the upper 47.5 m (156 ft) and added it to the Mount Hawk Formation, making the thickness of the Perdrix Formation at Roche Miette 116 m (380 ft).",53.268,-117.594

They do, in fact range from blocky clays and claystones to true shales. Generally they have limited fissility, poor induration and a substantial, if variable, content of silt and sand. They contain numerous bedded concretions, some calcareous, others noncalcareous and sectarian and others again composed of mixed rusty iron oxides. The arenaceous rocks, composed mainly of weakly cemented, fine to medium sized grains of quartz, feldspars, chert, glauconite, various nonopaque heavy mineral and iron oxides, form widely traceable units in many parts of the plains. In some parts they occur only near the base and top of the formation; in others they alternate with argillaceous units throughout. Commonly clayey and silty near the base, the arenaceous units are usually thick-bedded to massive, display an increase in grain size and 'purity' in upward sequence, and may be capped by a prominent bed of hard, resistant sandstone. They carry various kinds of bedded concretions, some large, calcareous and fossiliferous, others small, composed of mixed iron oxides and unfossiliferous. Thin beds and partings of bentonite (altered volcanic ash) occur throughout the formation but are concentrated in the middle shaly beds. Marine foraminifers and molluscs also are recurrent throughout, and banks and carpets of rock-forming inoceramid, mytilaceid, ostreid and pteriaceid bivalves are present locally. The argillaceous units suggest the prevalence of open sea conditions of the deposition; the arenaceous units point to episodes of shallowing, perhaps accompanied by regression; the highest beds of some sandy units providing evidence of deposition in brackish waters of the intertidal zone.  Distribution: Widely distributed through southern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan, where it forms much of the bedrock surface, the Bearpaw Formation can be traced from Montana as far northwards as Edmonton, with an outlier believed to exist in the Buffalo Head Hills of northern Alberta, and from the Rocky Mountain foothills as far eastwards as Regina. Thicknesses are variable, but because of its wedge-like form generally decrease northwards and westwards. Originally estimated to be about 183 m (600 ft) at the type locality and 230 m (750 ft) in the southern interior plains of Canada, the latter figure would be conservative even as an average. About 350 m (1148 ft) would be a more appropriate figure for the thickness in the Qu'Appelle and South Saskatchewan River valleys of south Saskatchewan, 300 m (984 ft) in the Alberta-Saskatchewan borderland, 150 m (492 ft) in the western part of the outcrop belt between Bassano and Castor in southern Alberta, and 30 m (98 ft) in the subsurface between Calgary and Drumheller in southern Alberta. The formation retains a notable thickness of about 290 m (951 ft) in the Crowsnest River valley of the southernmost Rocky Mountain foothills.  Type Locality: The Bearpaw Mountains of north-central Montana (48 deg 15'N, 109 deg 30'W) where the 'Bearpaw shales ... are well developed around the northern, eastern and southern borders' (Hatcher and Stanton, 1903, p. 212).  Relationship: in apparently conformable relationship the Bearpaw Formation succeeds the Belly River Formation in the southern Rocky Mountain Foothills, and the Judith River Formation eastwards across the plains. It is apparently conformably succeeded by the Blood Reserve and the overlying St. Mary River Formation in southwestern Alberta, by the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (in places with a thick series of transitional beds) in the main outcrop of the southern Alberta Plains between the Bow River and Battle River valleys, and by the sequence of thin units known, in ascending order as the Eastend, Whitemud and Battle formations in the Cypress Hills of the Alberta-Saskatchewan borderland, in the South Saskatchewan River valley and other parts of southwestern Saskatchewan. From mid-Saskatchewan the Bearpaw Formation thins westwards by facies change between its lowest and highest beds of marine silty clays and sands and continental to marginal-lmarine sandy beds of the underlying the overlying formations. Eastwards it loses it identity where the underlying Judith River is replaced by the Pierre Shale. There it loses its sandy members by facies change into silty clays and becomes the upper part of the Pierre Shale (formerly Riding Mountain Formation) in the eastern plains of Saskatchewan and the Manitoba escarpment. Northwards from southwestern Saskatchewan the Bearpaw Formation is thinned by pre-Pleistocene erosion and disappears completely south of the North Saskatchewan River valley. Only to the northwest can it be traced as a diminishing wedge as far as Edmonton, where it ultimately passes completely by facies change into the Judith River Formation below and the Edmonton Group above. Further northwest the Judith River Formation and Edmonton Group comprise the Wapiti Formation which, in the Foothills is equivalent of the Brazeau Formation. From its type area in the Bearpaw Mountains the Bearpaw Formation can be traced across northern Montana, where it displays similar stratigraphic relationships to those in Alberta and Saskatchewan. West of Great Falls the formation wedges to the point of disappearance by facies change with the underlying Judith River Formation and overlying Horsethief Sand, St. Mary River and Hell Creek formations. Beyond the point of disappearance the nonmarine formations coalesce to form the Two Medicine Formation, which includes thick volcanic products. Eastwards from the type locality, to the border with North Dakota the Bearpaw Formation persists, underlain by the Judith River Formation (in marine sandy facies) and succeeded by the Fox Hills Sandstone and overlying Hell Creek Formation. The Judith River Formation disappears in the borderland with North Dakota, beyond which the Bearpaw Formation becomes the upper part of the Pierre Shale.Equivalent to USGS Lexicon record: http://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Geolex/Units/Bearpaw_6743.html","list(atts = list(list()), name = ""shale"", prop = 1, lith_id = 8, type = ""siliciclastic"", class = ""sedimentary"")","list(class = ""marine"", type = """", name = ""inferred marine"", environ_id = 93)",49.06,-113.881,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Framboids,70.575,74.975,Bearpaw Formation,"list(atts = list(list()), name = ""shale"", prop = 1, lith_id = 8, type = ""siliciclastic"", class = ""sedimentary"")","list(class = ""marine"", type = """", name = ""inferred marine"", environ_id = 93)","Lithology: Dark grey clays, claystones, silty claystones, shales, silts and siltstones, with subordinate brownish grey silty sands, sands and sandstones; numerous concretionary beds, and thin beds of bentonite are the principal rock of sediment types of the Bearpaw Formations The argillaceous rocks have been variously described; originally called 'clay shales', this term has been perpetuated by some subsequent workers, but most have referred to them as shales.

Beyond the point of disappearance the nonmarine formations coalesce to form the Two Medicine Formation, which includes thick volcanic products. Eastwards from the type locality, to the border with North Dakota the Bearpaw Formation persists, underlain by the Judith River Formation (in marine sandy facies) and succeeded by the Fox Hills Sandstone and overlying Hell Creek Formation. The Judith River Formation disappears in the borderland with North Dakota, beyond which the Bearpaw Formation becomes the upper part of the Pierre Shale.Equivalent to USGS Lexicon record: http://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Geolex/Units/Bearpaw_6743.html","list(atts = list(list()), name = ""shale"", prop = 1, lith_id = 8, type = ""siliciclastic"", class = ""sedimentary"")","list(class = ""marine"", type = """", name = ""marine"", environ_id = 38)",49.268,-113.837,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Framboids,70.575,75.9333,Bearpaw Formation,"list(atts = list(list()), name = ""shale"", prop = 1, lith_id = 8, type = ""siliciclastic"", class = ""sedimentary"")","list(class = ""marine"", type = """", name = ""marine"", environ_id = 38)","Lithology: Dark grey clays, claystones, silty claystones, shales, silts and siltstones, with subordinate brownish grey silty sands, sands and sandstones; numerous concretionary beds, and thin beds of bentonite are the principal rock of sediment types of the Bearpaw Formations The argillaceous rocks have been variously described; originally called 'clay shales', this term has been perpetuated by some subsequent workers, but most have referred to them as shales. They do, in fact range from blocky clays and claystones to true shales. Generally they have limited fissility, poor induration and a substantial, if variable, content of silt and sand. They contain numerous bedded concretions, some calcareous, others noncalcareous and sectarian and others again composed of mixed rusty iron oxides. The arenaceous rocks, composed mainly of weakly cemented, fine to medium sized grains of quartz, feldspars, chert, glauconite, various nonopaque heavy mineral and iron oxides, form widely traceable units in many parts of the plains. In some parts they occur only near the base and top of the formation; in others they alternate with argillaceous units throughout. Commonly clayey and silty near the base, the arenaceous units are usually thick-bedded to massive, display an increase in grain size and 'purity' in upward sequence, and may be capped by a prominent bed of hard, resistant sandstone. They carry various kinds of bedded concretions, some large, calcareous and fossiliferous, others small, composed of mixed iron oxides and unfossiliferous. Thin beds and partings of bentonite (altered volcanic ash) occur throughout the formation but are concentrated in the middle shaly beds. Marine foraminifers and molluscs also are recurrent throughout, and banks and carpets of rock-forming inoceramid, mytilaceid, ostreid and pteriaceid bivalves are present locally. The argillaceous units suggest the prevalence of open sea conditions of the deposition; the arenaceous units point to episodes of shallowing, perhaps accompanied by regression; the highest beds of some sandy units providing evidence of deposition in brackish waters of the intertidal zone.  Distribution: Widely distributed through southern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan, where it forms much of the bedrock surface, the Bearpaw Formation can be traced from Montana as far northwards as Edmonton, with an outlier believed to exist in the Buffalo Head Hills of northern Alberta, and from the Rocky Mountain foothills as far eastwards as Regina. Thicknesses are variable, but because of its wedge-like form generally decrease northwards and westwards. Originally estimated to be about 183 m (600 ft) at the type locality and 230 m (750 ft) in the southern interior plains of Canada, the latter figure would be conservative even as an average. About 350 m (1148 ft) would be a more appropriate figure for the thickness in the Qu'Appelle and South Saskatchewan River valleys of south Saskatchewan, 300 m (984 ft) in the Alberta-Saskatchewan borderland, 150 m (492 ft) in the western part of the outcrop belt between Bassano and Castor in southern Alberta, and 30 m (98 ft) in the subsurface between Calgary and Drumheller in southern Alberta. The formation retains a notable thickness of about 290 m (951 ft) in the Crowsnest River valley of the southernmost Rocky Mountain foothills.  Type Locality: The Bearpaw Mountains of north-central Montana (48 deg 15'N, 109 deg 30'W) where the 'Bearpaw shales ... are well developed around the northern, eastern and southern borders' (Hatcher and Stanton, 1903, p. 212).  Relationship: in apparently conformable relationship the Bearpaw Formation succeeds the Belly River Formation in the southern Rocky Mountain Foothills, and the Judith River Formation eastwards across the plains. It is apparently conformably succeeded by the Blood Reserve and the overlying St. Mary River Formation in southwestern Alberta, by the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (in places with a thick series of transitional beds) in the main outcrop of the southern Alberta Plains between the Bow River and Battle River valleys, and by the sequence of thin units known, in ascending order as the Eastend, Whitemud and Battle formations in the Cypress Hills of the Alberta-Saskatchewan borderland, in the South Saskatchewan River valley and other parts of southwestern Saskatchewan. From mid-Saskatchewan the Bearpaw Formation thins westwards by facies change between its lowest and highest beds of marine silty clays and sands and continental to marginal-lmarine sandy beds of the underlying the overlying formations. Eastwards it loses it identity where the underlying Judith River is replaced by the Pierre Shale. There it loses its sandy members by facies change into silty clays and becomes the upper part of the Pierre Shale (formerly Riding Mountain Formation) in the eastern plains of Saskatchewan and the Manitoba escarpment. Northwards from southwestern Saskatchewan the Bearpaw Formation is thinned by pre-Pleistocene erosion and disappears completely south of the North Saskatchewan River valley. Only to the northwest can it be traced as a diminishing wedge as far as Edmonton, where it ultimately passes completely by facies change into the Judith River Formation below and the Edmonton Group above. Further northwest the Judith River Formation and Edmonton Group comprise the Wapiti Formation which, in the Foothills is equivalent of the Brazeau Formation. From its type area in the Bearpaw Mountains the Bearpaw Formation can be traced across northern Montana, where it displays similar stratigraphic relationships to those in Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Relationship: in apparently conformable relationship the Bearpaw Formation succeeds the Belly River Formation in the southern Rocky Mountain Foothills, and the Judith River Formation eastwards across the plains. It is apparently conformably succeeded by the Blood Reserve and the overlying St. Mary River Formation in southwestern Alberta, by the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (in places with a thick series of transitional beds) in the main outcrop of the southern Alberta Plains between the Bow River and Battle River valleys, and by the sequence of thin units known, in ascending order as the Eastend, Whitemud and Battle formations in the Cypress Hills of the Alberta-Saskatchewan borderland, in the South Saskatchewan River valley and other parts of southwestern Saskatchewan. From mid-Saskatchewan the Bearpaw Formation thins westwards by facies change between its lowest and highest beds of marine silty clays and sands and continental to marginal-lmarine sandy beds of the underlying the overlying formations. Eastwards it loses it identity where the underlying Judith River is replaced by the Pierre Shale. There it loses its sandy members by facies change into silty clays and becomes the upper part of the Pierre Shale (formerly Riding Mountain Formation) in the eastern plains of Saskatchewan and the Manitoba escarpment. Northwards from southwestern Saskatchewan the Bearpaw Formation is thinned by pre-Pleistocene erosion and disappears completely south of the North Saskatchewan River valley. Only to the northwest can it be traced as a diminishing wedge as far as Edmonton, where it ultimately passes completely by facies change into the Judith River Formation below and the Edmonton Group above. Further northwest the Judith River Formation and Edmonton Group comprise the Wapiti Formation which, in the Foothills is equivalent of the Brazeau Formation. From its type area in the Bearpaw Mountains the Bearpaw Formation can be traced across northern Montana, where it displays similar stratigraphic relationships to those in Alberta and Saskatchewan. West of Great Falls the formation wedges to the point of disappearance by facies change with the underlying Judith River Formation and overlying Horsethief Sand, St. Mary River and Hell Creek formations. Beyond the point of disappearance the nonmarine formations coalesce to form the Two Medicine Formation, which includes thick volcanic products. Eastwards from the type locality, to the border with North Dakota the Bearpaw Formation persists, underlain by the Judith River Formation (in marine sandy facies) and succeeded by the Fox Hills Sandstone and overlying Hell Creek Formation. The Judith River Formation disappears in the borderland with North Dakota, beyond which the Bearpaw Formation becomes the upper part of the Pierre Shale.Equivalent to USGS Lexicon record: http://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Geolex/Units/Bearpaw_6743.html",52.175,-106.489

They do, in fact range from blocky clays and claystones to true shales. Generally they have limited fissility, poor induration and a substantial, if variable, content of silt and sand. They contain numerous bedded concretions, some calcareous, others noncalcareous and sectarian and others again composed of mixed rusty iron oxides. The arenaceous rocks, composed mainly of weakly cemented, fine to medium sized grains of quartz, feldspars, chert, glauconite, various nonopaque heavy mineral and iron oxides, form widely traceable units in many parts of the plains. In some parts they occur only near the base and top of the formation; in others they alternate with argillaceous units throughout. Commonly clayey and silty near the base, the arenaceous units are usually thick-bedded to massive, display an increase in grain size and 'purity' in upward sequence, and may be capped by a prominent bed of hard, resistant sandstone. They carry various kinds of bedded concretions, some large, calcareous and fossiliferous, others small, composed of mixed iron oxides and unfossiliferous. Thin beds and partings of bentonite (altered volcanic ash) occur throughout the formation but are concentrated in the middle shaly beds. Marine foraminifers and molluscs also are recurrent throughout, and banks and carpets of rock-forming inoceramid, mytilaceid, ostreid and pteriaceid bivalves are present locally. The argillaceous units suggest the prevalence of open sea conditions of the deposition; the arenaceous units point to episodes of shallowing, perhaps accompanied by regression; the highest beds of some sandy units providing evidence of deposition in brackish waters of the intertidal zone.  Distribution: Widely distributed through southern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan, where it forms much of the bedrock surface, the Bearpaw Formation can be traced from Montana as far northwards as Edmonton, with an outlier believed to exist in the Buffalo Head Hills of northern Alberta, and from the Rocky Mountain foothills as far eastwards as Regina. Thicknesses are variable, but because of its wedge-like form generally decrease northwards and westwards. Originally estimated to be about 183 m (600 ft) at the type locality and 230 m (750 ft) in the southern interior plains of Canada, the latter figure would be conservative even as an average. About 350 m (1148 ft) would be a more appropriate figure for the thickness in the Qu'Appelle and South Saskatchewan River valleys of south Saskatchewan, 300 m (984 ft) in the Alberta-Saskatchewan borderland, 150 m (492 ft) in the western part of the outcrop belt between Bassano and Castor in southern Alberta, and 30 m (98 ft) in the subsurface between Calgary and Drumheller in southern Alberta.

They do, in fact range from blocky clays and claystones to true shales. Generally they have limited fissility, poor induration and a substantial, if variable, content of silt and sand. They contain numerous bedded concretions, some calcareous, others noncalcareous and sectarian and others again composed of mixed rusty iron oxides. The arenaceous rocks, composed mainly of weakly cemented, fine to medium sized grains of quartz, feldspars, chert, glauconite, various nonopaque heavy mineral and iron oxides, form widely traceable units in many parts of the plains. In some parts they occur only near the base and top of the formation; in others they alternate with argillaceous units throughout. Commonly clayey and silty near the base, the arenaceous units are usually thick-bedded to massive, display an increase in grain size and 'purity' in upward sequence, and may be capped by a prominent bed of hard, resistant sandstone. They carry various kinds of bedded concretions, some large, calcareous and fossiliferous, others small, composed of mixed iron oxides and unfossiliferous. Thin beds and partings of bentonite (altered volcanic ash) occur throughout the formation but are concentrated in the middle shaly beds. Marine foraminifers and molluscs also are recurrent throughout, and banks and carpets of rock-forming inoceramid, mytilaceid, ostreid and pteriaceid bivalves are present locally. The argillaceous units suggest the prevalence of open sea conditions of the deposition; the arenaceous units point to episodes of shallowing, perhaps accompanied by regression; the highest beds of some sandy units providing evidence of deposition in brackish waters of the intertidal zone.  Distribution: Widely distributed through southern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan, where it forms much of the bedrock surface, the Bearpaw Formation can be traced from Montana as far northwards as Edmonton, with an outlier believed to exist in the Buffalo Head Hills of northern Alberta, and from the Rocky Mountain foothills as far eastwards as Regina. Thicknesses are variable, but because of its wedge-like form generally decrease northwards and westwards. Originally estimated to be about 183 m (600 ft) at the type locality and 230 m (750 ft) in the southern interior plains of Canada, the latter figure would be conservative even as an average. About 350 m (1148 ft) would be a more appropriate figure for the thickness in the Qu'Appelle and South Saskatchewan River valleys of south Saskatchewan, 300 m (984 ft) in the Alberta-Saskatchewan borderland, 150 m (492 ft) in the western part of the outcrop belt between Bassano and Castor in southern Alberta, and 30 m (98 ft) in the subsurface between Calgary and Drumheller in southern Alberta. The formation retains a notable thickness of about 290 m (951 ft) in the Crowsnest River valley of the southernmost Rocky Mountain foothills.  Type Locality: The Bearpaw Mountains of north-central Montana (48 deg 15'N, 109 deg 30'W) where the 'Bearpaw shales ... are well developed around the northern, eastern and southern borders' (Hatcher and Stanton, 1903, p. 212).  Relationship: in apparently conformable relationship the Bearpaw Formation succeeds the Belly River Formation in the southern Rocky Mountain Foothills, and the Judith River Formation eastwards across the plains. It is apparently conformably succeeded by the Blood Reserve and the overlying St. Mary River Formation in southwestern Alberta, by the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (in places with a thick series of transitional beds) in the main outcrop of the southern Alberta Plains between the Bow River and Battle River valleys, and by the sequence of thin units known, in ascending order as the Eastend, Whitemud and Battle formations in the Cypress Hills of the Alberta-Saskatchewan borderland, in the South Saskatchewan River valley and other parts of southwestern Saskatchewan. From mid-Saskatchewan the Bearpaw Formation thins westwards by facies change between its lowest and highest beds of marine silty clays and sands and continental to marginal-lmarine sandy beds of the underlying the overlying formations. Eastwards it loses it identity where the underlying Judith River is replaced by the Pierre Shale. There it loses its sandy members by facies change into silty clays and becomes the upper part of the Pierre Shale (formerly Riding Mountain Formation) in the eastern plains of Saskatchewan and the Manitoba escarpment. Northwards from southwestern Saskatchewan the Bearpaw Formation is thinned by pre-Pleistocene erosion and disappears completely south of the North Saskatchewan River valley. Only to the northwest can it be traced as a diminishing wedge as far as Edmonton, where it ultimately passes completely by facies change into the Judith River Formation below and the Edmonton Group above. Further northwest the Judith River Formation and Edmonton Group comprise the Wapiti Formation which, in the Foothills is equivalent of the Brazeau Formation. From its type area in the Bearpaw Mountains the Bearpaw Formation can be traced across northern Montana, where it displays similar stratigraphic relationships to those in Alberta and Saskatchewan. West of Great Falls the formation wedges to the point of disappearance by facies change with the underlying Judith River Formation and overlying Horsethief Sand, St. Mary River and Hell Creek formations. Beyond the point of disappearance the nonmarine formations coalesce to form the Two Medicine Formation, which includes thick volcanic products. Eastwards from the type locality, to the border with North Dakota the Bearpaw Formation persists, underlain by the Judith River Formation (in marine sandy facies) and succeeded by the Fox Hills Sandstone and overlying Hell Creek Formation. The Judith River Formation disappears in the borderland with North Dakota, beyond which the Bearpaw Formation becomes the upper part of the Pierre Shale.Equivalent to USGS Lexicon record: http://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Geolex/Units/Bearpaw_6743.html","list(atts = list(list()), name = ""shale"", prop = 1, lith_id = 8, type = ""siliciclastic"", class = ""sedimentary"")","list(class = ""marine"", type = """", name = ""inferred marine"", environ_id = 93)",50.426,-104.963,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Framboids,70.575,74.0167,Bearpaw Formation,"list(atts = list(list()), name = ""shale"", prop = 1, lith_id = 8, type = ""siliciclastic"", class = ""sedimentary"")","list(class = ""marine"", type = """", name = ""inferred marine"", environ_id = 93)","Lithology: Dark grey clays, claystones, silty claystones, shales, silts and siltstones, with subordinate brownish grey silty sands, sands and sandstones; numerous concretionary beds, and thin beds of bentonite are the principal rock of sediment types of the Bearpaw Formations The argillaceous rocks have been variously described; originally called 'clay shales', this term has been perpetuated by some subsequent workers, but most have referred to them as shales.

Type Locality: The Bearpaw Mountains of north-central Montana (48 deg 15'N, 109 deg 30'W) where the 'Bearpaw shales ... are well developed around the northern, eastern and southern borders' (Hatcher and Stanton, 1903, p. 212).  Relationship: in apparently conformable relationship the Bearpaw Formation succeeds the Belly River Formation in the southern Rocky Mountain Foothills, and the Judith River Formation eastwards across the plains. It is apparently conformably succeeded by the Blood Reserve and the overlying St. Mary River Formation in southwestern Alberta, by the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (in places with a thick series of transitional beds) in the main outcrop of the southern Alberta Plains between the Bow River and Battle River valleys, and by the sequence of thin units known, in ascending order as the Eastend, Whitemud and Battle formations in the Cypress Hills of the Alberta-Saskatchewan borderland, in the South Saskatchewan River valley and other parts of southwestern Saskatchewan. From mid-Saskatchewan the Bearpaw Formation thins westwards by facies change between its lowest and highest beds of marine silty clays and sands and continental to marginal-lmarine sandy beds of the underlying the overlying formations. Eastwards it loses it identity where the underlying Judith River is replaced by the Pierre Shale. There it loses its sandy members by facies change into silty clays and becomes the upper part of the Pierre Shale (formerly Riding Mountain Formation) in the eastern plains of Saskatchewan and the Manitoba escarpment. Northwards from southwestern Saskatchewan the Bearpaw Formation is thinned by pre-Pleistocene erosion and disappears completely south of the North Saskatchewan River valley. Only to the northwest can it be traced as a diminishing wedge as far as Edmonton, where it ultimately passes completely by facies change into the Judith River Formation below and the Edmonton Group above. Further northwest the Judith River Formation and Edmonton Group comprise the Wapiti Formation which, in the Foothills is equivalent of the Brazeau Formation. From its type area in the Bearpaw Mountains the Bearpaw Formation can be traced across northern Montana, where it displays similar stratigraphic relationships to those in Alberta and Saskatchewan. West of Great Falls the formation wedges to the point of disappearance by facies change with the underlying Judith River Formation and overlying Horsethief Sand, St. Mary River and Hell Creek formations. Beyond the point of disappearance the nonmarine formations coalesce to form the Two Medicine Formation, which includes thick volcanic products. Eastwards from the type locality, to the border with North Dakota the Bearpaw Formation persists, underlain by the Judith River Formation (in marine sandy facies) and succeeded by the Fox Hills Sandstone and overlying Hell Creek Formation. The Judith River Formation disappears in the borderland with North Dakota, beyond which the Bearpaw Formation becomes the upper part of the Pierre Shale.Equivalent to USGS Lexicon record: http://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Geolex/Units/Bearpaw_6743.html","list(atts = list(list()), name = ""shale"", prop = 1, lith_id = 8, type = ""siliciclastic"", class = ""sedimentary"")","list(class = ""marine"", type = """", name = ""marine"", environ_id = 38)",49.549,-108.599,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Framboids,71.0833,74.0167,Bearpaw Formation,"list(atts = list(list()), name = ""shale"", prop = 1, lith_id = 8, type = ""siliciclastic"", class = ""sedimentary"")","list(class = ""marine"", type = """", name = ""marine"", environ_id = 38)","Lithology: Dark grey clays, claystones, silty claystones, shales, silts and siltstones, with subordinate brownish grey silty sands, sands and sandstones; numerous concretionary beds, and thin beds of bentonite are the principal rock of sediment types of the Bearpaw Formations The argillaceous rocks have been variously described; originally called 'clay shales', this term has been perpetuated by some subsequent workers, but most have referred to them as shales. They do, in fact range from blocky clays and claystones to true shales. Generally they have limited fissility, poor induration and a substantial, if variable, content of silt and sand. They contain numerous bedded concretions, some calcareous, others noncalcareous and sectarian and others again composed of mixed rusty iron oxides. The arenaceous rocks, composed mainly of weakly cemented, fine to medium sized grains of quartz, feldspars, chert, glauconite, various nonopaque heavy mineral and iron oxides, form widely traceable units in many parts of the plains. In some parts they occur only near the base and top of the formation; in others they alternate with argillaceous units throughout. Commonly clayey and silty near the base, the arenaceous units are usually thick-bedded to massive, display an increase in grain size and 'purity' in upward sequence, and may be capped by a prominent bed of hard, resistant sandstone. They carry various kinds of bedded concretions, some large, calcareous and fossiliferous, others small, composed of mixed iron oxides and unfossiliferous. Thin beds and partings of bentonite (altered volcanic ash) occur throughout the formation but are concentrated in the middle shaly beds. Marine foraminifers and molluscs also are recurrent throughout, and banks and carpets of rock-forming inoceramid, mytilaceid, ostreid and pteriaceid bivalves are present locally. The argillaceous units suggest the prevalence of open sea conditions of the deposition; the arenaceous units point to episodes of shallowing, perhaps accompanied by regression; the highest beds of some sandy units providing evidence of deposition in brackish waters of the intertidal zone.  Distribution: Widely distributed through southern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan, where it forms much of the bedrock surface, the Bearpaw Formation can be traced from Montana as far northwards as Edmonton, with an outlier believed to exist in the Buffalo Head Hills of northern Alberta, and from the Rocky Mountain foothills as far eastwards as Regina.

Commonly clayey and silty near the base, the arenaceous units are usually thick-bedded to massive, display an increase in grain size and 'purity' in upward sequence, and may be capped by a prominent bed of hard, resistant sandstone. They carry various kinds of bedded concretions, some large, calcareous and fossiliferous, others small, composed of mixed iron oxides and unfossiliferous. Thin beds and partings of bentonite (altered volcanic ash) occur throughout the formation but are concentrated in the middle shaly beds. Marine foraminifers and molluscs also are recurrent throughout, and banks and carpets of rock-forming inoceramid, mytilaceid, ostreid and pteriaceid bivalves are present locally. The argillaceous units suggest the prevalence of open sea conditions of the deposition; the arenaceous units point to episodes of shallowing, perhaps accompanied by regression; the highest beds of some sandy units providing evidence of deposition in brackish waters of the intertidal zone.  Distribution: Widely distributed through southern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan, where it forms much of the bedrock surface, the Bearpaw Formation can be traced from Montana as far northwards as Edmonton, with an outlier believed to exist in the Buffalo Head Hills of northern Alberta, and from the Rocky Mountain foothills as far eastwards as Regina. Thicknesses are variable, but because of its wedge-like form generally decrease northwards and westwards. Originally estimated to be about 183 m (600 ft) at the type locality and 230 m (750 ft) in the southern interior plains of Canada, the latter figure would be conservative even as an average. About 350 m (1148 ft) would be a more appropriate figure for the thickness in the Qu'Appelle and South Saskatchewan River valleys of south Saskatchewan, 300 m (984 ft) in the Alberta-Saskatchewan borderland, 150 m (492 ft) in the western part of the outcrop belt between Bassano and Castor in southern Alberta, and 30 m (98 ft) in the subsurface between Calgary and Drumheller in southern Alberta. The formation retains a notable thickness of about 290 m (951 ft) in the Crowsnest River valley of the southernmost Rocky Mountain foothills.  Type Locality: The Bearpaw Mountains of north-central Montana (48 deg 15'N, 109 deg 30'W) where the 'Bearpaw shales ... are well developed around the northern, eastern and southern borders' (Hatcher and Stanton, 1903, p. 212).  Relationship: in apparently conformable relationship the Bearpaw Formation succeeds the Belly River Formation in the southern Rocky Mountain Foothills, and the Judith River Formation eastwards across the plains. It is apparently conformably succeeded by the Blood Reserve and the overlying St. Mary River Formation in southwestern Alberta, by the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (in places with a thick series of transitional beds) in the main outcrop of the southern Alberta Plains between the Bow River and Battle River valleys, and by the sequence of thin units known, in ascending order as the Eastend, Whitemud and Battle formations in the Cypress Hills of the Alberta-Saskatchewan borderland, in the South Saskatchewan River valley and other parts of southwestern Saskatchewan. From mid-Saskatchewan the Bearpaw Formation thins westwards by facies change between its lowest and highest beds of marine silty clays and sands and continental to marginal-lmarine sandy beds of the underlying the overlying formations. Eastwards it loses it identity where the underlying Judith River is replaced by the Pierre Shale. There it loses its sandy members by facies change into silty clays and becomes the upper part of the Pierre Shale (formerly Riding Mountain Formation) in the eastern plains of Saskatchewan and the Manitoba escarpment. Northwards from southwestern Saskatchewan the Bearpaw Formation is thinned by pre-Pleistocene erosion and disappears completely south of the North Saskatchewan River valley. Only to the northwest can it be traced as a diminishing wedge as far as Edmonton, where it ultimately passes completely by facies change into the Judith River Formation below and the Edmonton Group above. Further northwest the Judith River Formation and Edmonton Group comprise the Wapiti Formation which, in the Foothills is equivalent of the Brazeau Formation. From its type area in the Bearpaw Mountains the Bearpaw Formation can be traced across northern Montana, where it displays similar stratigraphic relationships to those in Alberta and Saskatchewan. West of Great Falls the formation wedges to the point of disappearance by facies change with the underlying Judith River Formation and overlying Horsethief Sand, St. Mary River and Hell Creek formations. Beyond the point of disappearance the nonmarine formations coalesce to form the Two Medicine Formation, which includes thick volcanic products. Eastwards from the type locality, to the border with North Dakota the Bearpaw Formation persists, underlain by the Judith River Formation (in marine sandy facies) and succeeded by the Fox Hills Sandstone and overlying Hell Creek Formation. The Judith River Formation disappears in the borderland with North Dakota, beyond which the Bearpaw Formation becomes the upper part of the Pierre Shale.Equivalent to USGS Lexicon record: http://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Geolex/Units/Bearpaw_6743.html",50.011,-114.265

Relationship: The Harmon is transitionally and conformably overlain by the Cadotte Member of the Peace River Formation and conformably underlain by the Notikewin Member of the Spirit River Formation. It correlates with the Hulcross Member of the Commotion Formation of the Pine Pass area of British Columbia and with the middle shale member (Wildhorn Member, Stott, 1981) of the Scatter Formation of the Liard River area. The Harmon may be in part equivalent to part of the Mountain Park Formation in the central Alberta Foothills. A correlative relationship to the Joli Fou Formation of the Athabasca drainage has been suggested in the past, but microfaunal evidence clearly indicates the Harmon to be much older than the Joli Fou (Caldwell et al., 1978).  History: This shale was originally called the middle shale member of the Peace River Formation (McLearn, 1918; Wickenden, 1951) . The Alberta Study Group (1954) equated it to the Joli Fou Formation, but Joli Fou equivalents lie above the Cadotte horizon, not below (Oliver, 1960).",54.826,-115.211

The lower member is composed of dark grey to greenish grey mudstones containing quartz silt and variable amounts of limestone and dolomite. There is an upward increase in carbonate, with development of silty and argillaceous limestones towards the top of the member. The upper member is composed of strongly silty limestones and calcareous sandstones. Detailed examination of Upper Devonian basin sections between the Snake Indian and Brazeau rivers (Coppold, 1976 and unpub.) shows the Sassenach Formation to be strongly silty at the top and base, with a thick silk carbonate in the middle. Within these units the Sassenach Formation is composed of interbedded and interlaminated rocks which are divisible into two gross lithologies based on the presence or absence of a strong silty component. The lithologies are always laminated and frequently are cross-laminated. Interbedding relationships may be planar, undulose or nodular. Close to carbonate buildups of the Fairholme Group the basal part of the formation may contain fossils or calcarenite eroded from the buildups. Penecontemporaneous slump structures are common in the lower part of the Sassenach Formation.

In the western Huronian belt, the Thessalon Formation and correlative subaerial basalt formations up to 1000 m thick overlie a basal arkose unit (Livingstone Creek Formation) and are succeeded by subarkose of the Matinenda Formation. The McKim Formation, a pelite-wacke-quartz arenite unit at the top of the group which is as much as 3 km thick near Sudbury, thins westward and wedges out near Elliot Lake due partly to erosion prior to deposition of the unconformably overlying Hough Lake Group (Card and Jackson, 1995).  Distribution: The Elliot Lake Group occurs at the base of the Huronian succession. The Huronian Supergroup occurs in a northerly-concave arcuate fold belt, 200 miles long and about 40 miles wide, in the Southern province, along the north shore of Lake Huron (Frarey and Roscoe, 1970).  Type Locality: The type area for the originally defined 'Elliot' Group is in the Quirke Lake-Elliot Lake area (Roscoe, 1957).  Relationship: The Huronian Supergroup succession has been subdivided into four groups (Roscoe, 1969; Robertson et al., 1969) in ascending order: Elliot Lake, Hough Lake, Quirke Lake, and Cobalt groups. The Elliot Lake Group contains volcanic rocks - the Thessalon, Elsie Mountain, Stobie and Copper Cliff Formations, feldspathic quartzite - the Matinenda and Livingstone Creek Formations, and argillaceous sediments - the McKim Formation. Successions within the group differ in various parts of the belt. Volcanics are widespread areally (Salmay Lake, Baldwin, Agnew Lake, and Pater are other informal names applied locally to volcanics of the Elliot Lake Group between Blind River and Sudbury), but are most abundant at the western and eastern ends (Frarey and Roscoe, 1970; Card and Jackson, 1995). The Huronian rocks unconformably overlie Archean basement rocks. The basal Ramsay Lake Formation of the Hough Lake Group conformably to disconformably overlies the McKim; locally in the north the Ramsay Lake rests unconformably on volcanic rocks of the Elliot Lake Group and on Archean basement (Card and Jackson, 1995).  History: The Elliot Lake Group (originally Elliot Group), as defined in its type area (Roscoe, 1957), comprised the basal Matinenda Formation, mainly feldspathic quartzite, and the overlying Nordic Formation, mainly argillite. As a result of subsequent mapping and exploration drilling, volcanic rocks have also been recognized within the group at various places in the Huronian belt (Robertson et al., 1969; Card et al., 1971).

The mudstone is usually poorly fissile, soft to firm and moderately calcareous (due to the common calcareous microfossils).  The mudstone is locally carbonaceous and pyritic.  The limestone is generally microcrystalline and hard producing a low gamma and high velocity spikes.

Carrigy (1959) divided the McMurray Formation into three members. The lower, which is present only in selected depressions on the underlying Devonian surface consists of conglomerate, poorly sorted, and argillaceous sand, silt and clay. The middle member comprises two distinct facies: a lower, massive to thick-bedded unit of moderately well-sorted, fine-grained oil sand, dominated by large scale trough cross-beds; and an upper unit consisting of solitary sets of inclined strata, up to 25 m (82 ft) thick, with depositional slopes averaging 8 deg  to 12 deg , consisting of decimetre to metre thick beds of fine-grained, rippled oil sand separated by thin partings of argillaceous silt, with various degrees of burrowing throughout. Strata of the upper member consists of horizontally bedded, argillaceous, very fine-grained oil sand, commonly burrowed, locally bearing a restricted brackish water fauna (Mellon and Wall, 1956). This three-fold breakdown of the formation is applicable throughout the Fort McMurray outcrop area, but is not everywhere evident in the subsurface (Mossop, 1980).  Distribution: Averages 60 m (197 ft) thick in the heart of the Athabasca Oil Sands (Twp. 80-100, Rges. 7-11W4M), thinning westward against a Paleozoic high. East of the Athabasca deposit, where the McMurray Formation is devoid of oil its thickness is in the order of 30 m (98 ft). The formation is recognized in northeastern Alberta as far south as Twp. 50, where it exhibits patchy bitumen saturation in the Cold Lake Oil Sands deposit. The most notable characteristic of the McMurray Formation is that it is the reservoir for the Athabasca Oil Sands, which constitute one of the world's largest oil accumulations, with bitumen resources estimated at 138 x 109 m3 (868 x 109 bbls.)

In ascending order, these are: Dawson Settlement Member, light grey, calcareous, quartz-feldspathic sandstone, and light to dark grey calcareous shale and sandstone; Frederick Brook Member, dark brown to black, organic-rich marlstone (oil shale), sandy marlstone, and massive dolomitic marlstone; Hiram Brook Member, light to dark grey, locally calcareous and/or organic-rich mudstone, brownish-grey, calcareous to non-calcareous, quartz-feldspathic sandstone, and minor quartzose sandstone and limestone. Outside the type area, `oil shale' is rare and this threefold subdivision is not readily recognized. Conglomerate is commonly present in the lower and upper members outside the type area.  Distribution: Total thickness varies from less than 100 m to over 1800 m (McCutcheon, 1978). The Albert Formation outcrops intermittently from College Bridge (NTS 21 H/15), on the Memramcook River, southwestward along the northern flank of the Caledonia Highlands to Waterford (NTS 21 H/11) in Kings County. A second belt extends from Indian Mountain (NTS 21 I/2) north of Moncton to Smith Creek (NTS 21 H/14) near Sussex. There is also a large outcrop area between Sussex and Bloomfield Station (NTS 21 H/12).  Type Locality: Frederick Brook in the vicinity of Albert Mines, Albert County, New Brunswick (NTS 21 H/15E).  Relationship: The Albert Formation conformably overlies and, in part, is laterally equivalent to the Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous Memramcook Formation and is conformably overlain and, in part, laterally equivalent to the Lower Carboniferous `Weldon Formation' (McCutcheon, 1978). By current definition the contacts of the Albert Formation are drawn on the basis of colour (Gussow, 1953, p. 30), rather than lithostratigraphy. The Albert is in fault contact with pre-Carboniferous rocks between Prosser Brook and Albert Mines (NTS 21 H/15E). Younger rocks, assigned to the Hillsborough Member of the Moncton Formation and Enrage Formation of the Hopewell Group, unconformably overlie the Albert Formation. The Horton Group in New Brunswick includes in ascending order, the Memramcook, Albert and Moncton formations.  History: Gesner (1841, p. 27-28) briefly described 'bituminous' rocks along Frederick Brook, in the type area of the Albert Formation, and mentioned other localities, but considered them to be coal and part of his 'Westmorland Coal Field.' Robb (1850) stated that 'no coal whatever' occurred in this area. Dawson (1853) studied the geology in the Albert Mines area, concluded that the 'calcareo-bituminous-shales' were the base of the lower carboniferous series, and suggested a correlation with Horton Bluff in Nova Scotia. Bailey (1865) showed that the Albert shales were not at the base, being separated from pre-Carboniferous strata by conglomerates, and that 'bituminous shales' could be found as far west as Norton (NTS 21 H/12) in Kings County. Matthew (1863) reported fossils that confirmed the Early Carboniferous age of the Albert near Norton and also suggested a correlation with Horton Bluff rocks in Nova Scotia. Bailey and Ells (1878) formally defined the Albert shales, which were called the Baltimore shales in the vicinity of Rosevale. Ami (1900c) first used the term Albert Formation. Ells (1903) first suggested, and later (1908) maintained, a Late Devonian age for the formation based on correlation with the Perry Formation in western New Brunswick. Young (1912) mapped the Albert Series in the Moncton area. Wright (1922) divided his Albert Series into basal conglomerate, sandstone, and shale (Zone No. 1), oil shale and barren shale (Zone No. 2), and sandstone and shale (Zone No. 3). Bell (1927a), Hayes (1927), and Norman (1941a, 1941b) used Albert Formation again. Gussow (1953) outlined the regional distribution of the Albert Formation. Greiner (1962) subdivided it into three members approximating those of Wright (1922). King (1963) described the petrography of the oil shale. Kelley (1970, in Poole et al., 1970) and van de Poll (1972) assigned the Albert Formation to the Horton Group. Greiner (1974b) demonstrated the lacustrine origin of the formation and Pickerill and Carter (1980) described its depositional environment in more detail.","list(atts = list(c(""quartz"", ""feldspathic""), character(0)), name = c(""sandstone"", ""shale""), prop = c(0.5, 0.5), lith_id = c(10, 8), type = c(""siliciclastic"", ""siliciclastic""), class = c(""sedimentary"", ""sedimentary""))","list(class = ""non-marine"", type = """", name = ""non-marine"", environ_id = 88)",45.815,-65.368,Nodules,352.758,357.272,Albert Formation,"list(atts = list(c(""quartz"", ""feldspathic""), character(0)), name = c(""sandstone"", ""shale""), prop = c(0.5, 0.5), lith_id = c(10, 8), type = c(""siliciclastic"", ""siliciclastic""), class = c(""sedimentary"", ""sedimentary""))","list(class = ""non-marine"", type = """", name = ""non-marine"", environ_id = 88)","Lithology: The Albert Formation is divided into three members.

Dawson (1853) studied the geology in the Albert Mines area, concluded that the 'calcareo-bituminous-shales' were the base of the lower carboniferous series, and suggested a correlation with Horton Bluff in Nova Scotia. Bailey (1865) showed that the Albert shales were not at the base, being separated from pre-Carboniferous strata by conglomerates, and that 'bituminous shales' could be found as far west as Norton (NTS 21 H/12) in Kings County. Matthew (1863) reported fossils that confirmed the Early Carboniferous age of the Albert near Norton and also suggested a correlation with Horton Bluff rocks in Nova Scotia. Bailey and Ells (1878) formally defined the Albert shales, which were called the Baltimore shales in the vicinity of Rosevale. Ami (1900c) first used the term Albert Formation. Ells (1903) first suggested, and later (1908) maintained, a Late Devonian age for the formation based on correlation with the Perry Formation in western New Brunswick. Young (1912) mapped the Albert Series in the Moncton area. Wright (1922) divided his Albert Series into basal conglomerate, sandstone, and shale (Zone No. 1), oil shale and barren shale (Zone No. 2), and sandstone and shale (Zone No. 3). Bell (1927a), Hayes (1927), and Norman (1941a, 1941b) used Albert Formation again. Gussow (1953) outlined the regional distribution of the Albert Formation. Greiner (1962) subdivided it into three members approximating those of Wright (1922). King (1963) described the petrography of the oil shale. Kelley (1970, in Poole et al., 1970) and van de Poll (1972) assigned the Albert Formation to the Horton Group. Greiner (1974b) demonstrated the lacustrine origin of the formation and Pickerill and Carter (1980) described its depositional environment in more detail.",45.815,-65.368

In ascending order, these are: Dawson Settlement Member, light grey, calcareous, quartz-feldspathic sandstone, and light to dark grey calcareous shale and sandstone; Frederick Brook Member, dark brown to black, organic-rich marlstone (oil shale), sandy marlstone, and massive dolomitic marlstone; Hiram Brook Member, light to dark grey, locally calcareous and/or organic-rich mudstone, brownish-grey, calcareous to non-calcareous, quartz-feldspathic sandstone, and minor quartzose sandstone and limestone. Outside the type area, `oil shale' is rare and this threefold subdivision is not readily recognized. Conglomerate is commonly present in the lower and upper members outside the type area.  Distribution: Total thickness varies from less than 100 m to over 1800 m (McCutcheon, 1978). The Albert Formation outcrops intermittently from College Bridge (NTS 21 H/15), on the Memramcook River, southwestward along the northern flank of the Caledonia Highlands to Waterford (NTS 21 H/11) in Kings County. A second belt extends from Indian Mountain (NTS 21 I/2) north of Moncton to Smith Creek (NTS 21 H/14) near Sussex. There is also a large outcrop area between Sussex and Bloomfield Station (NTS 21 H/12).  Type Locality: Frederick Brook in the vicinity of Albert Mines, Albert County, New Brunswick (NTS 21 H/15E).  Relationship: The Albert Formation conformably overlies and, in part, is laterally equivalent to the Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous Memramcook Formation and is conformably overlain and, in part, laterally equivalent to the Lower Carboniferous `Weldon Formation' (McCutcheon, 1978). By current definition the contacts of the Albert Formation are drawn on the basis of colour (Gussow, 1953, p. 30), rather than lithostratigraphy. The Albert is in fault contact with pre-Carboniferous rocks between Prosser Brook and Albert Mines (NTS 21 H/15E). Younger rocks, assigned to the Hillsborough Member of the Moncton Formation and Enrage Formation of the Hopewell Group, unconformably overlie the Albert Formation.

In some sections the Maligne Formation contains thin shaly stringers every few decimetres in addition to the overall argillaceous character of the limestones. Brachiopods and crinoids are common in the Maligne, particularly toward the top of the formation. In proximity to carbonate buildups of the Fairholme Group the lithology and fossil content become more varied. Skeletal wackestones and even rare packstones containing crinoids, brachiopods, gastropods and cephalopods, together with buildup-derived calcareous algae, thamnoporid coral and stromatoporoid fragments are common. Peloid and intraclast wackestones also occur near the buildup margins. The upper Maligne Formation also exhibits some burrowed or bored horizons, and pyrite nodules are frequently seen on these bedding planes.  Distribution: The Maligne Formation is 15.8 m (52 ft) thick at the type section and generally varies between 12 and 30 m (39 and 98 ft) thick, with the maximum development adjacent to Fairholme carbonate buildup margins. The Maligne is recognized in basinal sections of Fairholme Group in the Rocky Mountains, from the Cecilia and Kakwa Lakes area of northeastern British Columbia to the Cline River area in the south, a distance of 300 km (186 mi). The Maligne Formation thins away from buildup margins and appears to be absent in some basin sections (e.g., Mountjoy, 1965; Belyea, 1978, fig. 2). Stratigraphic and facies relationships suggest that the Maligne Formation occurs as broad halos surrounding carbonate buildups (Coppold, 1976; Mountjoy and Mackenzie, 1973).

(53 deg 03'N, 118 deg 05'W)  Locality Data: Thickness(m): Minimum 12, Maximum 30, Typical 15.8.  Relationship: The Maligne Formation overlies the Flume Formation with a sharp (possibly paraconformable) contact, and is conformably overlain by the Perdrix Formation. In the Jasper area the Maligne Formation grades laterally to the base of the upper member of the Cairn Formation of the carbonate buildups. Due to the recessive weathering of the Maligne this transition is often hidden in outcrop sections. Where seen the Maligne may interfinger with Cairn dolomite tongues or grade smoothly into dark Cairn dolomites. The Maligne Formation thins into the basin and may be absent in some basin sections located far from carbonate buildups. This lateral relationship apparently does not hold in the extreme northwest. Maurin and Raasch (1972), on the basis of paleontologic evidence favor the original assignment of Maligne-type facies as a 'lateral shaly equivalent of upper Flume carbonates' (p. 14) and reject formation status for the unit. However, the Flume Formation in northeastern British Columbia is probably older than more southerly exposures and it seems reasonable for Maligne-type sediments to be lateral equivalents of either uppermost Flume or basal Cairn carbonates, depending upon their position in the basin. The subsurface equivalent of the Maligne Formation in the plains to the east is the Duvernay Formation.  History: Formerly the upper member of the Flume Formation of Raymond (1930), it was raised to formation status and named the Maligne by Taylor (1957) because its lithology differs distinctly from that of the underlying beds.

Stratigraphic and facies relationships suggest that the Maligne Formation occurs as broad halos surrounding carbonate buildups (Coppold, 1976; Mountjoy and Mackenzie, 1973).  Type Locality: Cold Sulphur Spring, roadside exposure along Highway 16, 21 km (13 mi) north of Jasper townsite. (53 deg 03'N, 118 deg 05'W)  Locality Data: Thickness(m): Minimum 12, Maximum 30, Typical 15.8.  Relationship: The Maligne Formation overlies the Flume Formation with a sharp (possibly paraconformable) contact, and is conformably overlain by the Perdrix Formation. In the Jasper area the Maligne Formation grades laterally to the base of the upper member of the Cairn Formation of the carbonate buildups. Due to the recessive weathering of the Maligne this transition is often hidden in outcrop sections. Where seen the Maligne may interfinger with Cairn dolomite tongues or grade smoothly into dark Cairn dolomites. The Maligne Formation thins into the basin and may be absent in some basin sections located far from carbonate buildups. This lateral relationship apparently does not hold in the extreme northwest. Maurin and Raasch (1972), on the basis of paleontologic evidence favor the original assignment of Maligne-type facies as a 'lateral shaly equivalent of upper Flume carbonates' (p. 14) and reject formation status for the unit. However, the Flume Formation in northeastern British Columbia is probably older than more southerly exposures and it seems reasonable for Maligne-type sediments to be lateral equivalents of either uppermost Flume or basal Cairn carbonates, depending upon their position in the basin. The subsurface equivalent of the Maligne Formation in the plains to the east is the Duvernay Formation.  History: Formerly the upper member of the Flume Formation of Raymond (1930), it was raised to formation status and named the Maligne by Taylor (1957) because its lithology differs distinctly from that of the underlying beds. Taylor designated Cold Sulphur Spring as the type section and used the earlier description of this section by Fox (1954) to define the formation.","list(atts = list(list(), list()), name = c(""shale"", ""limestone""), prop = c(0.8333, 0.1667), lith_id = c(8, 30), type = c(""siliciclastic"", ""carbonate""), class = c(""sedimentary"", ""sedimentary""))","list(class = ""marine"", type = """", name = ""inferred marine"", environ_id = 93)",53.268,-117.594,Nodules,379.55,380.075,Maligne Formation,"list(atts = list(list(), list()), name = c(""shale"", ""limestone""), prop = c(0.8333, 0.1667), lith_id = c(8, 30), type = c(""siliciclastic"", ""carbonate""), class = c(""sedimentary"", ""sedimentary""))","list(class = ""marine"", type = """", name = ""inferred marine"", environ_id = 93)","Lithology: The Maligne Formation consists of thin-bedded, dark grey to black argillaceous lime mudstones which weather rubbly and recessive. In some sections the Maligne Formation contains thin shaly stringers every few decimetres in addition to the overall argillaceous character of the limestones. Brachiopods and crinoids are common in the Maligne, particularly toward the top of the formation. In proximity to carbonate buildups of the Fairholme Group the lithology and fossil content become more varied. Skeletal wackestones and even rare packstones containing crinoids, brachiopods, gastropods and cephalopods, together with buildup-derived calcareous algae, thamnoporid coral and stromatoporoid fragments are common. Peloid and intraclast wackestones also occur near the buildup margins. The upper Maligne Formation also exhibits some burrowed or bored horizons, and pyrite nodules are frequently seen on these bedding planes.  Distribution: The Maligne Formation is 15.8 m (52 ft) thick at the type section and generally varies between 12 and 30 m (39 and 98 ft) thick, with the maximum development adjacent to Fairholme carbonate buildup margins.
