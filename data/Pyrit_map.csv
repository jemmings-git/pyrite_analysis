Discontinuous beds of quartzose muscovite schist, coarse grained to pebbly micaceous quartzite, and conglomeratic schist occur along the margins of the outcrop belt, stratigraphically at the base of the section. Interbeds of dacite metatuff occur in the western portion of the slate outcrop belt. Graded laminated metasiltstone and metasandstone are interbedded with slate in the central and eastern portions of the outcrop belt at the latitude of the James River (Evans and Marr, 1988); these rocks pass into porphyroblastic schists at higher metamorphic grades to the southwest. A distinctive garnet-amphibole-quartz interbed occurs within porphyroblastic schist south of the James River (volcanogenic marker?; Brown, 1969); north of the river, this passes down metamoprphic grade into what is described as an oolitic chlorite schist (Smith and others, 1964). Mineralogy: (slate) chlorite + mus co vite + plagioclase + quartz + magnetite ± biotite ± calcite ± graphite ± pyrite; (porphyroblastic schist) biotite + muscovite + garnet + quartz + plagioclase + magnetite ± kyanite ± calcite; tourmaline and zircon are common accessories. Geophysical signature: The Arvonia is marked by positive magnetic and radiometric anomalies. Originally referred to as the slate in the Arvonia belt by Rogers (1884), the unit was named Arvonia slate by Stose and Stose (1948), and raised to formation status by Brown (1969). An Upper Ordovician age for the Arvonia has been established from fossils collected by Watson and Powell (1911), Stose and Stose (1948), Tillman (1970), and Kolata and Pavlides (1986). The Arvonia has long been considered unconformable on top of adjacent units. Micaceous quartzite, pebbly mus covite schist, and conglomeratic schist are common at the base of the section where that boundary is not faulted (Stose and Stose, 1948; Smith and others, 1964; Brown, 1969; Evans and Marr, 1988). The base of the Arvonia is exposed in an old railroad cut near Carysbrook, Fluvanna County (Smith and others, 1964); there, a micaceous quartzite containing quartz pebbles rests on granite of the Carysbrook pluton. The Stoses (1948) considered the Arvonia a sequence deposited on a post-Taconic-orogeny regional unconformity, and folded and metamorphosed during subsequent orogenies; that interpretation is consistent with geologic constraints as we know them today. The Arvonia is correlated with the Quantico Formation. History of the Arvonia district slate industry is discussed by Brown (1969) and Evans and Marr (1988).","Central Virginia Volcanic-Plutonic Belt Original map source: Virginia Division of Mineral Resources, 2003, Digital Representation of the 1993 Geologic Map of Virginia, Publication 174, CD ROM (ISO-9660) contains image file, expanded explanation in pdf, and ESRI shapefiles, scale 1:500,000.",{metamorphic}

Characterized in part by distinctive 3 vaned columnals of the crinoid Dolatocrinus. Exposures of complete unit lacking in quadrangle owing to near surface weathering. Lag concentrate of phosphatic pebbles at base marks unconformity with underlying unit. In southeastern most exposures near Forest Hills, limestone lies directly on Louisville Limestone. \nEconomic (limestone): The chief mineral products within the quadrangle are dolomite and limestone used as crushed stone and, to a lesser extent, as building stone.  No building stone is currently produced.  Of numerous quarries, only one was operating in 1968.  Four units have been quarried: the Beechwood Limestone Member of the Sellersburg Limestone, the Louisville Limestone, the Laurel Dolomite, and the Saluda Dolomite Member of the Drakes Formation.  Plentiful supplies of all but the Beechwood Limestone Member remain.  The upper part of the Laurel Dolomite is the most extensively quarried rock in the quadrangle.  Large quantities of crushed rock are produced from this unit at a quarry near the south border.  More than half of the formation is being quarried at this site.  Smaller intervals were taken from now-abandoned quarries near Jeffersontown and Middletown.  In the northwestern part of the quadrangle, the Louisville Limestone and the Beechwood Limestone Member have been quarried along the drainages of Fern Creek and the South Fork of Beargrass Creek.  A small abandoned quarry near Floyds Fork indicates by its size limited, and probably local, use of the Saluda Dolomite Member. \nSILVER CREEK LIMESTONE MEMBER USGS Unit Info: not available   Limestone, dolomitic, argillaceous, olive gray to light greenish gray, weathers light yellowish gray; faintly mottled; laminated to cross-laminated by carbonaceous streaks and scattered thin lenses of very fine to medium grained fossil fragments; beds at base argillaceous, silty, pyritic, glauconitic, locally contains quartzose and phosphate pebbles.

In both dolomitized and undolomitized rocks, basal contact and contacts between subunits are fairly sharp. \nMiddle Part: Middle part is limestone and shale; limestone, light- to medium-gray, nodular, argillaceous; composed of whole and coarsely broken fossils, chiefly bryozoans and brachiopods, in a fine bioclastic groundmass, with gray shale as partings and interbeds. Middle part, fossiliferous limestone and shale, dolomitized farther from faults; grades into greenish-gray dolomitic shale similar to dolomitic shale of Terrill Member and shaly parts of Drakes and Crab Orchard Formations.  Partly destroyed fossils are preserved in dolomitic shale near margin of dolomitization, but decrease in abundance and disappear nearer to centers of dolomitized masses. \nLower Part: Lower part is limestone, yellowish-gray to grayish-brown, weathers very light gray; micrograined, contains abundant ostracodes and some cephalopods; in thin tabular beds locally thickened to smooth-surfaced bulbous masses.  Incomplete specimens of the bryozoan Amplexopora sp. were identified from collection near base of unit. \nEconomic (minerals): A northwest-striking vein, chiefly of barite and as much as 3 feet thick, occurs along the northeastern fault of the northwest-trending graben that crosses Dry Fork in the southwestern part of the quadrangle.  No barite was found below an elevation roughly coincident with the top of the Brannon Member of the Lexington Limestone on the upthrown side, and the top of Tanglewood Limestone Member on the downthrown side.  Coarsely crystalline calcite and barite cavity fillings and replacements occur sparsely in the Brassfield Dolomite.  Small inclusions of calcite, barite, dolomite, sphalerite, and pyrite were found in dolomitized parts of the Reba Member of the Ashlock Formation in this and the adjacent Winchester quadrangle (Black, 1974).  The abrupt change from limestone to dolomite in these beds, the increase in degree of alteration toward the faults, and the areal distribution of dolomitized rock adjacent to faults suggest that the faults were conduits for dolomitizing solutions.  Such solutions may have deposited materials of economic value at greater depth. \nTERRILL MEMBER USGS Unit Info: GEOLEX (id: 4085)   Dolomitic shale, moderate-grayish-green to light-greenish-gray, weathers to yellowish-brown clayey soil; fresh rock has blocky subconchoidal fracture, fissile where weathered.

Fossils identified are the brachiopods Platystrophia, Hebertella, Plaesyomys, and Zygospira; bryozoans Homotrypa cf. H. spinea Cummings and Galloway, Stigmatella? sp., Hallopora sp., Graptodictya sp., Peronopora? sp., Crepipora? sp., Mesotrypa? sp., Heterotrypa? sp., and Amplexopora? sp.  A few thin, even-surfaced beds of brownish-gray calcarenite and calcirudite are widely spaced throughout member.  Least common limestone type is very light gray to light brownish gray, micrograined to cryptograined, commonly ostracodal; some beds contain small sparry calcite-filled tubes; occurs only in upper part of member near west edge of quadrangle in a zone as much as 12 feet thick; base of zone indicated by a line on adjacent Winchester quadrangle (Black, 1974); zone may be correlative with Gilbert Member of the Ashlock Formation as mapped in southern Madison County (Greene, 1966 1967).

Very thin, even-surfaced, tabular beds of micrograined limestone occur widely spaced in green shale throughout member.  Basal contact generally sharp; similar in appearance to and may be mistaken for upper contact of Back Bed 10 to 15 feet higher in the section. \nBACK BED USGS Unit Info: GEOLEX (id: 223)   Limestone occurs chiefly in Back Bed in lower part of member, mostly a zone of irregularly bedded, fossiliferous limestone underlain and overlain by green shale; dessication cracks seen near middle of Back Bed at one locality in stream bottom east of bend in Crowe Ridge road about midway between Eagle Nest and Ruckerville faults.",Oa; Hedges Quadrangle (GQ-1235) | http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsweb/PubsSearching/MoreInfo.asp?titleInput=343 | Map description and column: http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsmap/kgsgeoserver/geolDescID.asp?idType=pointID&fmcode=361ALCK&gq_num=1235&map_level=24K,{sedimentary}

28151,21,Karheen and Cedar Cove Formations,Karheen Formation; Cedar Cove Formation,Devonian,"Gray, green and red sandstone, mudstone, and conglomerate, with subordinate platey limestone.  Sandstone and conglomerate compositions are highly variable and range from quartz-free volcaniclastic sandstone and clast supported, rounded cobble conglomerate to quartz-rich sandstone  and arkose with detrital mica. On Chichagof Island, unit includes the lower clastic member of the Cedar Cove Formation, which consists of dark green graywacke turbidites, greenish-gray siliceous argillite, tuff,  dark gray, thin-bedded limestone,  pebbly graywacke , crossbedded, red-weathering pebbly sandstone, pisolitic limestone, graywacke and tuffaceous chert and limestone beds, and clast-supported polymictic conglomerate that gradationally overlie the Kennel Creek limestone; the base is marked by first graywacke bed.  Graywacke contains quartz, plagioclase, potassium feldspar, biogenic debris, limestone, volcanic rock fragments, and secondary pyrite, chlorite, and epidote.  Graywacke was deposited as turbidites, debris flows, and pebbly crossbeds, indicating variable sub-wavebase to shallow water depths.  Clast supported conglomerate contains rounded, poorly sorted pebbles and cobbles consisting of volcanic rocks (50 per cent), graywacke (30 per cent) argillite (10 per cent) and a few per cent each of chert, limestone, granite, diorite, and red syenite. The graywacke member of the Cedar Cove Formation is locally as thick as 500 m, but thickness is variable, and the unit is locally absent between the underlying Kennel Creek Limestone and the overlying volcanic rocks of the Freshwater Bay Formation  (Loney and others, 1963). In Saginaw Bay red arkose, mudstone, and  polymictic conglomerate overlie the Kuiu Limestone and are depositionally overlain by pillow basalt. The arkose contains quartz, plagioclase, and chert but no K-feldspar or detrital mica have been reported.  On Prince of Wales Island unit includes the Karheen Formation, composed of sandstone, shale, and pebble, cobble, and boulder conglomerate that commonly weather red.  Sandstone is massive to crossbedded; it typically has pebbly trough crossbeds or festoon crossbeds and alternates with red mudstone and micrite that contain ripple marks and mudcracks. Sandstone is green, green-gray, and reddish-brown lithic wacke and graywacke with calcareous cement. Detrital K-feldspar and biotite distinguish Karheen sandstone from older sandstones, but locally sandstone is almost entirely volcaniclastic.  Sandstone locally grades to thin- to medium-bedded platey limestone and calcareous pyritic mudstone.  Mudstone is silty, red or green, and  locally contains ostracods, gastropods, brachiopods, and Early Devonian plant fossils.  Conglomerate clasts consist dominantly of mafic volcanic clasts and greenish-gray chert, with subordinate graywacke, siltstone, red chert, quartzite, white quartz, and limestone, and generally rare granitioid clasts. Conglomerate clasts are typically well-rounded with low sphericity, and have a red-brown ferruginous coating.  Pebbles and cobbles fill scour and lag deposits, and flat cobbles also form thin imbricated layers. Bedding features indicate a shallow marine tidal to fluviodeltaic depositional environment  (Ovenshine, 1975).  Conglomerate and cobble to boulder breccia form meter scale layers throughout the section, and locally form massive layers tens of meters in thickness.  On Logjam Creek massive boulder conglomerate consists almost entirely of rounded volcanic debris; near Staney Creek conglomerate commonly contains cobbles and boulders of pink-weathering granitic rock. Red pebbly sandstone and mudstone unconformably overlie the Heceta Limestone, locally filling a paleokarst surface. In other places conglomerate unconformably overlies the Descon Formation and Luck Creek Breccia. The Karheen Formation is laterally gradational to, and underlies Wadleigh limestone.

The Beekmantown Group in east-central NY includes the (ascending) Potsdam Sandstone, Ticonderoga Formation, Whitehall Formation, Great Meadows Formation, Fort Ann Formation, and Fort Cassin Formation. The Cambrian-Ordovician boundary is within the Whitehall Formation, and therefore, the Beekmantown Group is of Late Cambrian to Early Ordovician age (Croixian to Canadian). Unit overlies the Lake George Group and underlies the Black River Group (Fisher, 1984).  Paleozoic cover sequence adjacent to Adirondack massif in western part of Glens Falls quad consists of (ascending): Late Cambrian Potsdam Sandstone, Late Cambrian Ticonderoga Formation, Late Cambrian and Early Ordovician Beekmantown Group (with Whitehall Formation at base), early Middle Ordovician Chazy Group, Middle Ordovician Black River and Trenton Groups, and Mohawk Valley shales (Canajoharie Shale and Snake Hill Formation). Potsdam and Ticonderoga are partly correlative with Danby Formation of Middlebury synclinorium in VT. Beekmantown and part of Chazy correlate directly with limestones and dolomites above Danby. Paleozoic cover sequence is interpreted as a platform sequence. [Text states Beekmantown ""as used by Fisher (1984)"", but this appears to be an error because Fisher (1984) included Potsdam and Ticonderoga in his Beekmantown. Fisher (1977) abandoned Canajoharie but USGS still recognizes it.] (Thompson, 1990).  Little Falls - Unit is well known for its exceptionally clear, doubly terminated quartz crystals, known as ""diamonds"" and for the irregular masses of algal stromatolites, which occur at several levels, particularly in informal unit B. Brachiopods have been reported at several localities, but except for the stromatolites, the unit, for the most part, is unfossiliferous. Lithology is quite varied. Though dolostone is predominant, sandstone and mixed sandstone and dolostone beds are common. The mineralogy of the Little Falls is extremely varied. Unit includes quartz, calcite, dolomite, pyrite, marcasite, galena, sphalerite, limonite, chalcopyrite, hematite, glauconite, and anthraxolite. Inferred age of the quartz crystals is Carboniferous, while deposition of the limestone occurred during the Late Cambrian (Muskatt and Tollerton, 1992).  Hoyt - Named the Hoyt limestone member of the Little Falls dolomite for Hoyt's quarry, Saratoga Co., eastern NY. Unit is basal phase of the Little Falls. Consists of blackish, subcrystalline, pure or only slightly magnesian limestone alternating with beds of blue and light gray dolomite; quartz sand grains in some of the beds, increasing in amount below; contains many beds of black oolite, most abundant near the base. Fossils include Cryptozoan, trilobites, gastropods, and LINGULEPIS ACUMINATA at many horizons. Thickness is 80 to 120 feet. Gradationally overlies the Potsdam sandstone and underlies the remainder of the Little Falls dolomite. Unit occurs locally. The Hoyt is of Late Cambrian age (Ulrich and Cushing, 1910).  The base of the Whitehall formation is raised to coincide with contact of Little Falls dolomite and Hoyt limestone, and Hoyt is revised as lower member of Whitehall formation. The Hoyt limestone member is about 40 feet thick and underlies the Skene dolomite member (Wheeler, 1942).

Siltstone forms smooth weathering massive faces that grade laterally to slopes littered with elongate prisms 1/4 to 1 inch thick. Trace fossils on bedding planes include Scalarituba missouriensis Weller and smaller features Stockdale (1939) called ""curly worm marks"", resembling Cosmorhaphe sp. In quadrangle to south (Kepferle, 1972a), basal part of member intergrades with underlying unit within an interval of as much as 40 feet. Member covered by loess, rarely exposed. Position of basal contact in most areas placed at change from steeper slopes on Holtsclaw Siltstone Member to gentler slopes caused by decrease in silt content of underlying Nancy Member. \nNANCY MEMBER USGS Unit Info: GEOLEX (id: 2931)   Silty shale, medium to olive gray, weathers yellowish gray to light olive gray; clayey, locally calcareous, unevenly fissile. Forms steeper slopes and shows less tendency to slump than does clay shale of underlying unit. Basal part intergrades with New Providence Shale Member within interval of as much as 30 feet; contact generally obscured by loess mantle, placed at break in slope resulting in part from increase in clay content of underlying unit.

Contact mapped at highest continuous siltstone bed of Kenwood. \nNEW PROVIDENCE SHALE MEMBER USGS Unit Info: GEOLEX (id: 2983)   Clay shale and minor limestone: Clay shale, silty, olive gray to grayish green, weathers yellowish gray to light greenish gray; locally iron stained; contains scattered light brown to dark yellowish brown ellipsoidal ironstone concretions, commonly 4 inches across and as much as one foot long, particularly abundant along bedding planes within 70 feet below Kenwood Siltstone Member. Unit micaceous, illitic, plastic when wet. Clay filled worm(?) trails common, resemble Scalarituba missouriensis Weller (Conkin and Conkin, 1968). Crinoids, brachiopods, corals, pelecypods, gastropods, bryozoans, trilobites, and cephalopods rare to abundant in scattered thin limestone lenses 80 to 100 feet below the Kenwood. Limestone commonly underlain by persistent bed of concretionary siderite with double cone in cone structure; concretions are pale to grayish brown in middle with a dark-yellowish orange rind: bed exposed on lower northwestern part of Kenwood Hill nearly due west of north end of hilltop (Conkin, 1957, p. 118 119). An upper tongue 0 to 55 feet thick is separated from main unit by the Kenwood in southwestern part of area. Base of unit distinct; where exposed, base is marked by persistent zone of brownish gray phosphatic nodules and scattered glauconite, except at two localities where underlain by Rockford Limestone. \nEconomic (petroleum): Gas for domestic use has been obtained from at least two wells, now abandoned, in the vicinity of Palatka and Manslick Roads.  Limestone beneath the New Albany Shale contained shows of oil in a well drilled on St. Anthonys Church Road in southern part of map area, but no commercial oil or gas wells have been drilled. \nEconomic (clay, sand, gravel): Sand and gravel for aggregate, fill, and road metal are excavated from Wisconsin outwash north of Kramers Lane between Cane Run Road and Campground Road.  Fill for part of the roadbed of the newly built interstate highway system in the area consists of loess, colluvium, New Providence Shale Member of the Borden Formation, and weathered New Albany Shale obtained from a pit three-fourths of a mile south-southeast of intersection of U.S. Highway 31 W and 60, and Watterson Expressway.  Loess for topsoil and fill has been stripped from several areas east of the outwash plain. \nGeotechnical: Clay of the lacustrine deposits, the upper part of the outwash plain, and the New Providence becomes plastic when wet and moderate slopes tend to slump and slide.  Roads and other structures built on these units should be provided with adequate drainage and oversteepened cuts should be avoided.  The clayey units are relatively impermeable, and percolation rates may be too slow to provide adequate drainage for septic tanks.  However, ponds on these units should be successful. Permeability of the lacustrine and outwash deposits varies considerably depending on the amount of clay in the deposit. \nGeotechnical: An artificial floodwall provides protection against severe flooding for all but the southern part of the outwash plain.  The highest recorded water level was in January 1937, when 458.2 feet was recorded on the right bank of the Ohio River at river mile 611.5, and 457.0 feet was recorded on the left bank at river mile 616.9 (Grover, 1938, p. 616). \nHydrology: Water for industrial and domestic use is readily available from the outwash along the Ohio River (Rorabaugh, 1946; MacCary, 1956; Price, 1964a, b; Bell, 1966).  Water from the lower part of the Borden Formation, the New Albany Shale, and the underlying carbonate rocks is apt to be sulfurous or salty where encountered below stream level (Palmquist and Hall, 1960). \nLand-Use: Dimension stone from the siltstone beds of the Kenwood Siltstone Member of the Borden Formation has been used in foundations, walls, and some dwelling facings, but no commercial quarries are now operating.",Mb; Louisville West Quadrangle (GQ-1202) | http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsweb/PubsSearching/MoreInfo.asp?titleInput=325 | Map description and column: http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsmap/kgsgeoserver/geolDescID.asp?idType=pointID&fmcode=337BRDN&gq_num=1202&map_level=24K,{sedimentary}

Unit consists mainly of metavolcanic rocks.  Rock types include amphibolite, actinolite schist, garnet-plagioclase-hornblende semischist and gneiss, pelitic and semi-pelitic kyanite-garnet-biotite-feldspar-quartz schist, fine-grained quartz-feldspar-biotite schist, and marble; characterized by compositional layers a few cm to a meter in thickness.  In the Juneau area, unit includes foliated and layered medium- to coarse-grained hornblende gneiss with lesser amounts of hornblende and biotite schist (Brew and Ford, 1985; Himmelberg and others, 1991).  Protoliths are inferred to be basaltic, rhyolitic, and  dacitic volcanic rocks, pelite, quartz-rich clastic strata, and limestone. Quartz-porphyritic metarhyolite with large blue quartz phenocrysts in a centimeter scale fragmental texture is a diagnostic rock type (Gehrels and others, 1992).  Metarhyolite is commonly interlayered with metabasalt that sometimes displays relict fragmental and pillow structures. In Leconte and Thomas Bays, the unit includes amphibolite, muscovite-biotite pelitic schist, siliceous semischist, quartzite, and marble.  Marble layers range from 10 cm to 20 m in thickness. Siliceous semischist has layers that contain up to 75 per cent quartz and alternate on a cm-scale with finer-grained biotite-rich layers, inferred to represent sandstone turbidites (McClelland and others, 1991).  Quartzite forms cm- to meter-scale layers, contains less than 20 per cent plagioclase, K-feldspar, biotite, muscovite, amphibole, epidote, and opaques, locally alternating with sub-millimeter laminae of biotite and white mica, and is inferred to represent both quartzose sandstone and felsic tuff (McClelland and others, 1991).  Felsic metatuff occurs as meter-scale layers and as 1-10 cm-thick layers in marble (McClelland and others, 1991).  Amphibolite layers up to 30 m in thickness are inferred to represent mafic extrusive rocks; massive and homogenous plagioclase-garnet-hornblende gneiss may represent mafic flows or intrusive rocks (McClelland and others, 1991). In general the proportion of metavolcanic rocks increases southwestward.  Metaclastic quartzite and quartz-cobble conglomerate are more common to the northeast (Gehrels and others, 1992).

Ratio of microperthite to plagioclase is generally about 2:1.  Quartz constitutes 5-30 % of rock. Also includes glomerocrysts of green hornblende and brown biotite altered to chlorite, opaque minerals, zircon, medium brown garnet, and sphene.

32067,21,Volcanic and sedimentary rocks of Nakwasina Sound,,Triassic,"Gray and green volcaniclastic sandstone, mudstone, tuff, chert, limestone, and intermediate to mafic volcanic rocks. In Nakwasina Sound and near Red Bluff Bay the unit is recrystallized to greenstone, carbonaceous phyllite, marble, and semischist. The unit is composed dominantly of volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks, with interlayered marble and sooty, carbonaceous argillite. Augite and labradorite are relict primary minerals in the greenstone. Secondary minerals include epidote, pyrite, magnetite, and chalcopyrite. Common meter-scale lenses of limestone distinguish unit Trsv from rocks of the Kelp Bay Group. Rock types in Trsv alternate in layers meters to tens of meters thick, and are not chaotically mixed like rocks in the Khaz Complex. Mafic volcanic rocks are more massive, form thicker sections, and lack interbedded chert that characterizes the volcanic rocks of the Kelp Bay Group. On Baranof Island, primary depositional textures are preserved in volcaniclastic rocks, pillowed greenstone, bedded limestone, argillaceous limestone turbidites, mudstone, and bedded chert. Limestone and chert commonly have stylolitic bed partings. Unit represents mostly deep water, basinal sedimentary deposits. Unit is folded, faulted, and locally sheared. Unit thickness is unknown due to faulting. Unit occupies a higher structural position than the Kelp Bay Group. Tectonic blocks of Trsv may locally be faulted into the Khaz Complex; blocks of limestone and carbonaceous mudstone are suspected to be tectonic inclusions, possibly due to subduction erosion recycling processes as described by Clift and Vannucchi (2004) because they contrast with the siliceous argillite of the Khaz Complex and resemble rocks of the upper plate. Mylonitic structures in the Trsv unit at Red Bluff Bay postdate its metamorphic fabric. Trsv is intruded by Jurassic diorite on in Nakwasina Sound and on northeastern Yakobi Island (Johnson and Karl, 1985). Trsv is inferred to represent a depositional facies of massive Triassic volcanic rocks assigned to Wrangellia on the Baranof-Chichagof block (Jones and others, 1977).

Its texture is generally uneven, subhedral to subporphyritic, and locally cumulus. Crystals range from 0.5 to 1 cm (0.2 to 0.4 in.) long in the quartz-bearing rocks and are less uniform in the syenitic rocks. Most of the syenite is texturally equivalent to the granite, but the syenite commonly contains small, irregular pegmatitic patches that lack well-defined boundaries. The range (and median) of the principal minerals are: potassium feldspar, 53-85 (63) percent; plagioclase (An6-12), 0-22.5 (2.8) percent; quartz, 0-41 (24) percent; ferrohornblende, 0.1-17 (4.5) percent; biotite, 0-3.2 (0.8) percent; and opaque minerals, 0.2-7.5 (1.0) percent. Minor quantities of augite are in approximately one-quarter of the specimens. Accessory minerals include magnetite, ilmenite, zircon, apatite, and, very rarely, fluorite, pyrite or molybdenite. Carlsbad-twinned microcline microperthite is the dominant feldspar; less than 25 percent of the feldspar is homogeneous microcline. Plagioclase (albite or oligoclase) is present in only minor quantities. Quartz is clear, grayish, pinkish, or faintly smoky, shows weak strain shadows, and contains oriented sheets of dust-like inclusions and vesicles. Potassium feldspar and quartz occur as large single crystals and as clusters of subhedral to euhedral feldspar and anhedral quartz partly to completely surrounded by finer grained quartz and feldspar. The mafic minerals are variable in amount and appearance and occur as ragged clots, wisps, single subhedral crystals, and zoned reaction aggregates. Augite is colorless to pale green, typically occurring as a core that is partly or completely surrounded by pale-green amphibole, darker green sodium-iron amphibole, and reddish-brown biotite; magnetite granules are scattered throughout the aggregate. Sodium-iron amphibole and biotite occur as both isolated crystals and clots of both minerals. The mapped lithotypes of the Cape Ann Granite were determined by modal quartz content, because the amount of quartz in these subunits is consistent and varies smoothly in areas generally measurable in square kilometers (miles). Arbitrary divisions of 5, 15, and 25 volume percent of quartz were determined by point counts on outcrops. These lithotypes form irregular northeast-bending bands. Neither stratigraphic succession nor dips of these lithotypes is known, but field relations suggest the superposition of quartz-rich on quartz-poor types. The lithotypes probably originated by differential crystal settling, but may have had their origin in convective motions of the magma. Weathering causes sequential color changes in these felsic rocks from dark green to green gray or gray, then to brown, tan, and finally to white on exposed surfaces. The weathered surface is black-brown and grus is common under vegetation. Joints are commonly bordered by a brown zone a few centimeters (inches) thick. Xenoliths, which are generally small and well digested, but locally may retain their preincorporation character, are scattered throughout the intrusion. They include blocks of a fine-grained granite, probably the Squam Granite; Salem Gabbro-diorite and other fine-grained, commonly porphyritic mafic rocks; and siliceous metasedimentary rocks. Many of these latter were originally finely laminated (0.1 to 5 mm (0.004-0.2 in.)), but have been transformed by thermal metamorphism into thin-banded quartz-biotite rocks containing feldspars and hornblende. A few of these metasedimentary xenoliths contain muscovite, pyroxene, and garnet; one sample contains sillimanite.",{igneous}

34518,22,Calloway Creek Limestone,Calloway Creek Limestone,Upper Ordovician,"Limestone, clay shale, and minor siltstone; locally dolomitized: Limestone, mostly medium-light-gray, in very thin nodular to irregularly surfaced beds with very thin interbeds and partings of medium-gray, calcareous clay shale; fossiliferous, with brachiopods and bryozoans dominant.  Bioclastic calcarenite and calcirudite in even beds as much as 10 inches thick are concentrated at places near base but are also widely spaced throughout.  Siltstone, calcareous, in very thin, tabular beds, occurs sparsely throughout but is more abundant in lower part as interbeds with limestone and shale. \ndolomitic areas of the Calloway Creek Limestone: Adjacent to the Boonesborough fault in a zone extending from the ridge crest east of Stoner Branch to a hilltop west of Harris Branch, otherwise calcitic rocks of the Calloway Creek Limestone, Garrard Siltstone, and at least the upper part of the Clays Ferry Formation are almost completely altered to dolomite.  The dolomite in the Calloway Creek interval is strikingly similar in mode of outcrop, bedding character, and lithology to dolomite of the Drakes Formation.  Resistant dolomitized beds are thicker (0.3 to 0.1 foot) and are more evenly surfaced than those of unaltered limestone.  Weathered dolomite is generally light orange gray flecked with reddish brown, mottled with patches and swirls of light grayish green, with scattered patches of very light gray sparite.  Covered intervals between resistant beds of doIomite are wider and more prevalent than in comparably weathered outcrops of unaltered Calloway Creek.  In fresh cuts and drill cores these intervals are made up of poorly resistant beds of unctuous, light-grayish-green and reddish-brown, dolomitic mudstone and shale.  Cavity fillings of coarsely crystalline barite, dolomite, calcite, and pyrite occur in dolomite.  Zones of petroliferous vugs in partly dolomitized fossiliferous limestone interbedded with more completely dolomitized rock were noted in outcrops and in drill core thought to be near margin of the dolomitized zones.  At places, lateral transition from limestone to dolomite is very abrupt.  Tongues of dolomite extend well south of main dolomite body.  The entire Calloway Creek interval may be present at U. S. G. S. Allen No. 1 diamond-drill hole (shown in three cross sections); almost all of unit penetrated is dolomitized.  Basal Calloway Creek contact is placed at top of sequence of thick beds of siltstone with a few very thin interbeds of limestone overlain by limestone with some thin siItstone interbeds. \nEconomic (minerals): Anomalous bodies of dolomite occur at five localities in the quadrangle; they appear to be genetically related to faulting.  At least two of these occurrences, along the Boonesborough and Eagle Nest faults, are replacement deposits (Black, 1971), of a type commonly associated with commercial sulfide ore bodies (Schwartz, 1955).  Such dolomite bodies adjacent to faults may be useful guides in exploration for sulphide ore.  In the Boonesborough fault body, otherwise calcitic rocks of the Calloway Creek Limestone, Garrard Siltstone, and at least the upper 41 feet of the Clays Ferry Formation are dolomitized to a total drilling depth of 194 feet at the U. S. G. S. Allen No. 1 core hole site.  In the southeastern part of this quadrangle, and in the adjacent Hedges quadrangle, dolomite has replaced limestone of the Reba Member of the Ashlock Formation in a narrow elongate zone adjacent to the Eagle Nest fault.  Both outcrops and the drill core contain, as cavity fillings and replacements, small quantities of barite, pyrite, coarsely crystalline calcite, and dolomite; and, in dolomite of the Reba, sphalerite.  In the three grabens in the western part of the quadrangle north of the Boonesborough fault, neither field relations nor fossil evidence were sufficient to determine if the dolomite occurrences resulted from alteration of country rock, or if dolomitic strata higher in the stratigraphic section were downdropped by faults.",Occ; Winchester Quadrangle (GQ-1159) | http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsweb/PubsSearching/MoreInfo.asp?titleInput=306 | Map description and column: http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsmap/kgsgeoserver/geolDescID.asp?idType=pointID&fmcode=361CLCK&gq_num=1159&map_level=24K,{sedimentary}

The greenschists are generally vuggy due to the dissolution of calcite.  Some greenstone is albite porphyroblastic.  Subordinate marble forms lenses as thick as 80 m, which is mapped separately as Pzmm when possible. Marble locally retains relict bedding and has stylolitic partings. Meter-scale lenses of metachert, carbonaceous phyllite, and felsic schist are interlayered with the greenstone schists in some places. Other rock types include minor amounts of white mica schists, chlorite-white mica schists, meta-peridotite, and meta-gabbro. The unit is gradational to Pzcs (7315) which contains a higher proportion of sericitic and graphitic schists relative to Pzgs.  Protoliths of Pzgs are inferred to be dominantly volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of intermediate to mafic composition, with an admixture of calcareous clasts and mafic intrusive rocks. Relict igneous textures are preserved in some semischists. Locally greenstone retains primary coarse clastic or layered sedimentary textures; vuggy texture appears to be related to high content of calcite lenses that may include an admixture of calcareous clasts. Common maximum-phase mineral associations in the greenschists include albite-chlorite-actinolite-epidote-calcite-muscovite; quartz-albite-chlorite-actinolite-epidote; quartz-albite-chlorite-epidote-calcite-white mica. White mica schists consist of quartz-albite-chlorite-calcite-white mica or some subset of that mineral association.

Unit consists mainly of metavolcanic rocks.  Rock types include amphibolite, actinolite schist, garnet-plagioclase-hornblende semischist and gneiss, pelitic and semi-pelitic kyanite-garnet-biotite-feldspar-quartz schist, fine-grained quartz-feldspar-biotite schist, and marble; characterized by compositional layers a few cm to a meter in thickness.  In the Juneau area, unit includes foliated and layered medium- to coarse-grained hornblende gneiss with lesser amounts of hornblende and biotite schist (Brew and Ford, 1985; Himmelberg and others, 1991).  Protoliths are inferred to be basaltic, rhyolitic, and  dacitic volcanic rocks, pelite, quartz-rich clastic strata, and limestone. Quartz-porphyritic metarhyolite with large blue quartz phenocrysts in a centimeter scale fragmental texture is a diagnostic rock type (Gehrels and others, 1992).  Metarhyolite is commonly interlayered with metabasalt that sometimes displays relict fragmental and pillow structures. In Leconte and Thomas Bays, the unit includes amphibolite, muscovite-biotite pelitic schist, siliceous semischist, quartzite, and marble.  Marble layers range from 10 cm to 20 m in thickness. Siliceous semischist has layers that contain up to 75 per cent quartz and alternate on a cm-scale with finer-grained biotite-rich layers, inferred to represent sandstone turbidites (McClelland others, 1991).  Quartzite forms cm- to meter-scale layers, contains less than 20 per cent plagioclase, K-feldspar, biotite, muscovite, amphibole, epidote, and opaques, locally alternating with sub-millimeter laminae of biotite and white mica, and is inferred to represent both quartzose sandstone and felsic tuff (McClelland others, 1991).  Felsic metatuff occurs as meter-scale layers and as 1-10 cm-thick layers in marble (McClelland others, 1991).  Amphibolite layers up to 30 m in thickness are inferred to represent mafic extrusive rocks; massive and homogenous plagioclase-garnet-hornblende gneiss may represent mafic flows or intrusive rocks (McClelland others, 1991).

In Skagway quad, North and east of Chilkat River near Haines and on Chilkat Peninsula, includes massive, flow-banded, and locally pillowed or amygdaloidal metabasalt.  Contains magnetite, traces of malachite, pods and veins of epidote.  Associated tuffaceous metasediments.  Metamorphosed to low greenschist facies and intruded by the Mt. Kashagnak pluton, locally as thick as 3.4 km.  Dark green and black metabasalt and meta-andesite.  Flow units and intercalated metasedimentary rocks strike NW and dip steeply east.    Greenschist facies metamorphic mineral assemblages include albite, quartz, chlorite, epidote, actinolite, calcite, pyrite, and sphene.  Includes dark green, silvery green, and gray green phyllite and schist, with intercaltated metachert and marble and carbonaceous gray phyllite.  In Endicott Arm area, includes massive quartz-calcite-actinolite-epidote greenstone, massive plagioclase-actinolite-epidote-chlorite greenstone, and biotite-quartz-epidote-chlorite phyllite and schist.  Minor amounts of slate, quartzite, and metalimestone are also present  (Stowell and Hooper, 1990.) Taku terrane.  In Haines area, contains Late Triassic fossils (Gilbert and others, 1987).  In the Ketchikan area, carbonaceous limestone contains Late Middle Triassic ammonites, conodonts, and halobiid bivalves are associated with pillowed mafic flow rocks (Berg and Cruz, 1982; Silberling and others, 1982). Corresponds with part of MzPzmv of Berg and others, (1988), and upper Alava sequence of Rubin and Saleeby, (1991).  Some workers correlate these rocks with Wrangellia (Davis and Plafker, 1985; Plafker and others, 1989; Gehrels and Barker, 1993), but the stratigraphy of Trmv does not include a section of greenstone as thick as that of Wrangellia, it does not include subaerial basalt as Wrangellia does, and Trmv is not overlain by a limestone unit that would correspond to the Chitistone and/or Nizina Limestones.  Unit lies east of  the Chatham Strait-Denali fault; Trmv lies along strike with the Lions Head greenstones north of Berners Bay that are on strike with the Gastineau Group, the Alava sequence, and other units assigned to the Taku Terrane.  The rocks in the Skagway Quad are not like the Alava/Taku terrane, and may be the southern most tip of the piece of Wrangellia that was juxtaposed against the Taku Terrane, and extends up to the Kluane Lake area",,{metamorphic}

Unit also includes gray and green, thin- to medium-bedded volcaniclastic turbidites and interbedded tuff.  Graywacke is altered and recrystallized, contains relict grains of quartz, plagioclase, volcanic lithic fragments, felsite, and chert, and quartz-calcite-prehnite veins. On Chichagof Island, graywacke has an average composition of 20.7 per cent quartz, 14.5 per cent plagioclase, 2.1 per cent K-feldspar, 9.25 per cent sedimentary rock fragments, and 39.7 per cent volcanic rock fragments (n=6, in Decker, 1980a).  Volcanic wacke contains more volcanic lithic fragments than the graywacke, and up to 25 per cent matrix.  On northern Baranof Island, sandstone contains 5 to 15 per cent quartz, 10 to 25 per cent plagioclase, no K-feldspar identified by Na-cobaltinitrate staining (possibly due to recrystallization or alteration), 5 to 15 per cent sedimentary rock fragments, and 40 to 60 per cent volcanic rock fragments (S. Karl, unpublished data, n= 7). Conglomerate is matrix-supported in some places, and clast-supported in other  places.  Conglomerate clasts are dominantly sedimentary and volcanic, with subordinate diorite, chert, and limestone. Graywacke retains turbidite structures, including graded bedding, thinning upward cycles in sections with equal amounts of sandstone and mudstone, and mud-dominated sections with cm-scale layers of siltstone.  These bedding features suggest deposition in deep water.  Intercalated layers of calcareous mudstone contain lenses of altered tuff up to 4 m in thickness.  Although bedding structures are preserved, thin sections show a pervasive deformation fabric, ranging from an anastomosing cataclastic shear fabric to a planar flattening fabric.  Pebbles in Saouk Bay conglomerate are stretched to 5:1.  Secondary minerals include calcite, epidote, chlorite, sericite, pyrite, prehnite, and very rare biotite.  Plagioclase in most thin sections is altered to calcite.   This unit is more volcaniclastic, and pervasively more recrystallized and deformed than the Sitka Graywacke.  There are no fossils from the sandstone unit of the Kelp Bay Group on Baranof Island. This unit is depositionally associated with the Khaz Complex, which contains Cretaceous and Jurassic fossils.  Olistostromal blocks of graywacke in the Khaz Complex on the Khaz Peninsula on Chichagof Island contain Tithonian and Berriasian Buchia (Decker and others, 1979; Decker, 1980a), and graywacke of KJks is inferred to represent sandstone that is contemporaneous with mlange development, perhaps as slope basins on the accretionary complex, as described by Moore and others (1983). The unit is correlated with graywacke in the McHugh Complex, which contains interbedded chert that yielded Pliensbachian (Early Jurassic) radiolarians in Sadie Cove near Seldovia (Bradley and others, 1999), and which also contains detrital zircons as young as 84 Ma in Turnagain Arm (Amato and Pavlis, 2010; Karl and others, 2011).  Some of the graywacke in the Kelp Bay Group may also range as young as the Upper Cretaceous Valdez Group (Winkler and others, 1981), the Upper Cretaceous  Shumagin and Kodiak Formations (Connelly, 1978), and part of the Leech River Complex on Vancouver Island (Fairchild and Cowan, 1982)",,{sedimentary}

Sims (U.S. Geological Survey, written communication, 1968).  Analysis by electronic particle-size analyzer indicates the sample is composed of particles with a mean and median size or 6.850.  One standard deviation encompasses the sizes 4.3 microns to 17 microns (7.8395to 5.870) and accounts for 69 percent of the data.  Twelve and one-half percent of the particles are less than 4 microns (?80) and 1.4 percent are less than 2 microns (?90).  X-ray analysis indicates the sample is composed of 79 percent clay, 17 percent quartz, and 4 percent feldspar.  The clay fraction contains 26 percent kaolinite, 12 percent illite, 55 percent montmorillonite, and 7 percent mixed-layer clay minerals.  According to a differential thermal analysis by Sims ""dehydroxylization of the clay began at 530 degrees C and was complete at 660 degrees C. The endothermic maximum was at 610 degrees C.  Dehydroxylization at these temperatures is a result of endothermic reactions of montmorillonite and kaolinite."" R. H. Tschudy (written communication, 1968) reports that samples from fossil locality B and from a locality 0.5 mile to the south of it, in adjoining Wickliffe quadrangle, ""yielded characteristic lower Claiborne assemblages.""  According to Tschudy the sample from locality B ""was probably deposited in a continental site.  No dinoflagellates and hystrichospheres were found.  The alga Pediastrum suggests a lake or pond deposit.  The sample from [the] locality [0.5 mile to the south] yielded a very few specimens of dinoflagellates and hystrichospheres suggesting a slight marine influence.  The deposition site may have been deltaic, near enough to the sea to permit occasional marine inundations.""  Pollen assemblages from fossil localities C and D indicate a late Claiborne age according to Tschudy (written communication, 1968), who observes that the lack of dinoflagellates and the presence of Azolla [in the assemblage from locality C] suggests fresh-water deposition.""  Tschundy (1967, p. 48) reports that a fossil assemblage from fossil locality E was somewhat anamalous in that it contained ""several new species of palynomorphs in relatively large numbers""; however, because of the presence of other species he believes the assemblage is from the Claiborne Formation, probably from the lower part.",Tc; Barlow Quadrangle (GQ-885) | http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsweb/PubsSearching/MoreInfo.asp?titleInput=891 | Map description and column: http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsmap/kgsgeoserver/geolDescID.asp?idType=pointID&fmcode=124CLBN&gq_num=885&map_level=24K,{sedimentary}

Thinly-laminated medium-bluish-gray limestone with graded, graphitic silty partings; includes calcareous graphitic phyllite, and pyrite-bearing graphitic slate. Mineralogy: calcite + quartz + muscovite ± graphite ± chlorite ± albite ± pyrite + tourmaline. The Everona occurs dominantly as lenticular bodies immediately north west of or within the Mountain Run fault zone (Evans, 1984; Conley, 1989; Rossman, 1991). In most outcrops primary laminations are complexly folded due to strain accommodation associated with the Mountain Run fault. Unit thickness and degree of lateral continuity are structurally controlled in many places. Mack (1965) reports thicknesses ranging from about 20 to 1100 feet. Jonas (1927) reports retrieving trilobite fragments from sandy beds adjacent to the Everona, but these were so poorly preserved that E.O. Ulrich could not identify them, even with respect to genus. Recent attempts to extract conodonts from the Everona have so far proven fruitless. The Everona is interpreted to be in stratigraphic continuity with phyllites and metasiltstones that are conformable above the Catoctin Formation (Evans, 1984; Rossman, 1991), and is likely Early Paleozoic in age.","Blue Ridge Anticlinorium (Central) Original map source: Virginia Division of Mineral Resources, 2003, Digital Representation of the 1993 Geologic Map of Virginia, Publication 174, CD ROM (ISO-9660) contains image file, expanded explanation in pdf, and ESRI shapefiles, scale 1:500,000.","{metamorphic,sedimentary}"

No barite was found below an elevation roughly coincident with the top of the Brannon Member of the Lexington Limestone on the upthrown side, and the top of Tanglewood Limestone Member on the downthrown side.  Coarsely crystalline calcite and barite cavity fillings and replacements occur sparsely in the Brassfield Dolomite.  Small inclusions of calcite, barite, dolomite, sphalerite, and pyrite were found in dolomitized parts of the Reba Member of the Ashlock Formation in this and the adjacent Winchester quadrangle (Black, 1974).  The abrupt change from limestone to dolomite in these beds, the increase in degree of alteration toward the faults, and the areal distribution of dolomitized rock adjacent to faults suggest that the faults were conduits for dolomitizing solutions.  Such solutions may have deposited materials of economic value at greater depth. \nEconomic (clay, sand, gravel): Foerste (1906) reported that very sandy, pebbly clay was mined from a large clay pit (now a pond) along the roadbed of the Kentucky Union Railroad (since abandoned) three-fourths of a mile northwest of Indian Old Fields. \nStructure: Structural relief on the base of the Brassfield Dolomite is about 270 feet in the area of outcrop.

32572,21,Younger schist,,Devonian and Silurian?,"Pelitic, calcareous, and graphitic lithologies interlayered on a scale of centimeters to meters, exposed in the central Nome and Solomon quadrangles.  Interlayering is gradational and intimate. The unit is composed predominantly of pale brown and gray weakly- to well-foliated schists dominated by plagioclase, calcite, quartz, white mica, and graphite.   In the central Solomon quadrangle, where calcareous lithologies are subordinate to pelitic lithologies, the unit forms smooth rounded hills, or more commonly, is present in valleys and areas of subdued topography. Rarely forms outcrops; usually occurs as loose rubble on hills, stream cuts, or in low areas unit is covered by tundra.  Ridge-top outcrops and ridge-flanking tors are more common in the Nome quadrangle, but not abundant.Pelitic rocks are light to dark gray weathering and contain pale-colored chloritoid, glaucophane or pseudomorphs of chlorite and albite after glaucophane, and in rare cases, garnet; at some localities, micaceous laminae alternate with quartz-rich laminae.  Accessory minerals include epidote, clinozoisite, apatite, tourmaline, sphene, graphite, ilmenite, pyrite, rutile, and zircon.  Calc-schist is light to dark brownish-gray colored and commonly contains plagioclase, chloritoid, calcite, some dolomite, and rare garnet. Plagioclase commonly occurs as syn- and post-penetrative deformation metamorphic porphyroblasts. Accessory minerals include apatite, tourmaline, graphite, pyrite, rutile, and zircon.  Gray-weathering, plagioclase-rich lithologies are interlayered with orange- or brown-weathering impure marble or calcareous schist in some localities, mica- and graphite-rich schists in other localities.  Layers rich in chlorite and albite, with and without white mica and calcite, are generally less than 0.5 m thick.The unit includes relatively thin, but widely distributed, layers of light to dark gray or pale orange weathering mm-scale color laminated marble.  Marbles are slightly impure, most commonly with small concentrations or disseminations of quartz, white mica, and graphite; they also can include iron carbonate, iron oxide, and rare sulfide minerals.  Less common, but also broadly distributed, are layers typically less than 20 cm thick of pale tan- to white-weathering metaquartzite with fine laminations defined by minor iron carbonate, iron oxide, and white mica. Dark-gray to black-weathering, graphitic metasiliceous rock, locally micaceous, contains mm-scale laminae enriched in graphite, white mica, and iron oxide, and occurs in layers meters to tens of meters thick; these exposures are generally thinner than the graphitic metasiliceous layers in unit DOx.In the Nome quadrangle, a dark-gray to black weathering rock with striking white mm- to cm-thick lenses, layers, and irregular blobs of polycrystalline quartz forms layers a meter to several meters thick.  The matrix to the quartz concentrations is typically rich in white mica, graphite, chlorite, and albite in varying abundances.  Many exposures are resistant.  Some of the polycrystalline quartz lenses and blobs trace intrafolial isoclinal folds; more equant blobs occur on fold hinges. These features and other deformational characteristics of the Nome Complex are consistent with a protolith for this rock that had quartz-rich alternating with mica-rich layers, although its present appearance is suggestive of a conglomerate. This lithology is equivalent to the ""lumpy schist"" or ""pCPzspm"" of Bundtzen and others (1994).A lens of carbonate clast conglomerate, 10 to 15 m thick and >15 to 20 m long, occurs within Dcs in the Nome quadrangle near the Aurora Creek prospect. The conglomerate is poorly sorted, matrix supported, interlayered with schist, and has a matrix of calcareous schist that contains abundant quartz and white mica. Clasts are rounded to angular, elongate to disc-shaped, and as much as 75 cm in maximum diameter. Most are light gray to beige dolostone and medium gray marble.A distinctive lithologic package occurs along the western margin of the unit in the Nome quadrangle.  The package coincides with a long, linear resistivity low and magnetic high (Burns and others, 2005a,b).  Pale green and pale gray weathering, locally brown-weathering schists locally display mm- to cm-thick layers of sugary white quartz.  Rocks typically are interlayered concentrations of quartz with lesser iron carbonate and epidote versus white mica, medium-dark colored chloritoid, and locally epidote, iron carbonate, and chlorite. Chloritoid grains may occur in polycrystalline lenses within white mica laminae.  Epidote grains contain brown (allanite?) cores.  Brown-weathering layers are calcareous.  This lithology is part of the mineralized zone at the Aurora Creek and Christophosen Pb-Zn prospects.  Many detrital zircon samples collected from this unit contain small populations of Middle and Late Devonian zircons and large populations of early-middle Silurian zircons as well as older populations (Till and others, 2006; Till and others, 2008a).  Much or all of the unit is therefore Devonian or younger. Thickness of the unit is greater than 1.2 kilometers.A distinctive marble occurs in several outcrops that form a small lens within or adjacent to Dcs in the Nome quadrangle. The marble is white to light gray, generally impure (5 to 15 percent quartz, 1 to 5 percent white mica), and typically contains sand- to pebble-size clasts of dark gray to black, organic-rich marble. Most clast-bearing intervals appear to be clast-supported and some may be graded. Clasts are rounded to angular in shape, commonly laminated, and generally ?2 cm in diameter; a few clasts may be as much as 12 cm long. The clast-bearing marble produced conodonts with CAI values of 5 at two localities (Table A-1). One collection yielded a single element of Silurian(?) through Triassic age. The other collection, also a single conodont, is an Sb element of late Permian through Triassic (likely Triassic) age. There are three possible scenarios to explain the presence of a Triassic marble in the otherwise Devonian and older Nome Complex: (1) contamination of the conodont sample; (2) pre-metamorphic fault juxtaposition of Triassic and older rocks; and (3) a pre-metamorphic unconformable relationship between the Triassic and older rocks.  The CAI of this conodont is consistent with that of other Nome Complex rocks, and no rocks that could have produced such contamination (that is, rocks of known Permian or Triassic age and high thermal level) were being processed in the laboratory at the time the Seward Peninsula sample was run (A. Harris, written commun., 2005). Thus, the clast-bearing (Triassic?) marble was juxtaposed with Dcs before or during Jurassic metamorphism or may be a rare remnant of rocks that sat unconformably atop protoliths of the Nome Complex before those protoliths were metamorphosed.  Because of the uncertainties in the origin of this marble and its uniqueness, we choose not extend the protolith age of the Nome Complex to Triassic",,{metamorphic}

Unit consists mainly of metavolcanic rocks.  Rock types include amphibolite, actinolite schist, garnet-plagioclase-hornblende semischist and gneiss, pelitic and semi-pelitic kyanite-garnet-biotite-feldspar-quartz schist, fine-grained quartz-feldspar-biotite schist, and marble; characterized by compositional layers a few cm to a meter in thickness.  In the Juneau area, unit includes foliated and layered medium- to coarse-grained hornblende gneiss with lesser amounts of hornblende and biotite schist (Brew and Ford, 1985; Himmelberg and others, 1991).  Protoliths are inferred to be basaltic, rhyolitic, and  dacitic volcanic rocks, pelite, quartz-rich clastic strata, and limestone. Quartz-porphyritic metarhyolite with large blue quartz phenocrysts in a centimeter scale fragmental texture is a diagnostic rock type (Gehrels and others, 1992).  Metarhyolite is commonly interlayered with metabasalt that sometimes displays relict fragmental and pillow structures. In Leconte and Thomas Bays, the unit includes amphibolite, muscovite-biotite pelitic schist, siliceous semischist, quartzite, and marble.  Marble layers range from 10 cm to 20 m in thickness. Siliceous semischist has layers that contain up to 75 per cent quartz and alternate on a cm-scale with finer-grained biotite-rich layers, inferred to represent sandstone turbidites (McClelland others, 1991).  Quartzite forms cm- to meter-scale layers, contains less than 20 per cent plagioclase, K-feldspar, biotite, muscovite, amphibole, epidote, and opaques, locally alternating with sub-millimeter laminae of biotite and white mica, and is inferred to represent both quartzose sandstone and felsic tuff (McClelland others, 1991).  Felsic metatuff occurs as meter-scale layers and as 1-10 cm-thick layers in marble (McClelland others, 1991).  Amphibolite layers up to 30 m in thickness are inferred to represent mafic extrusive rocks; massive and homogenous plagioclase-garnet-hornblende gneiss may represent mafic flows or intrusive rocks (McClelland others, 1991). In general the proportion of metavolcanic rocks increases southwestward.  Metaclastic quartzite and quartz-cobble conglomerate are more common to the northeast (Gehrels and others, 1992). The rocks are strongly foliated and lineated, showing evidence for more than one deformation, and are locally proto mylonitic or phyllonitic.

Sandstones are composed of quartz, chert, and lithic grains, are mostly noncalcareous, and are well indurated. Centimeter-scale pyrite nodules with rusty orange-weathering haloes are common. Shale and mudstone near the base of the upper Schrader Bluff give way upward to a sandier succession organized into stacked coarsening- and thickening-upward parasequences 1025 m (3382 ft) thick. Sandstones in the upper parts of parasequences are typically medium- to thick-bedded, commonly with hummocky and swaley cross-stratification, and are frequently capped by sharp transgressive surfaces marked by a grit lag or shell hash. Bioturbation ranges from scant to intense, with Schaubcylindrichnus, Asterosoma, Rhizocorallium, Macaronichnus, Teichichnus, Diplocraterion, Planolites, Rosellia, and Paleophycus heberti (formerly Terebellina) among the most characteristic traces, consistent with deposition in shallow-water settings ranging from shoreface or proximal delta front to offshore environments. The general upward increase in sand content and grain size in the upper part of the Schrader Bluff Formation reflects a long aggradational and progradational history following the major transgressive flooding event that halted deposition of the middle Schrader Bluff (unit Ksbm) and the lower tongue of the Prince Creek Formation (unit Kpcl). Except for a few relatively continuous exposures along cutbanks and bluffs of the larger drainages, the most resistant sandstones of the upper Schrader Bluff unit form tundra-covered ridges with subtly expressed rubble traces. Finer-grained intervals, particularly the bentonitic mudstones (containing a maximum flooding surface) near the base of the unit, tend to form stream valleys and recessive slopes that contrast with the more competent sandy strata (representing maximum regression) near the top of the underlying middle Schrader Bluff map unit. Distinguishing between the upper and middle Schrader Bluff Formation map units can be difficult in isolated exposures; mapped contacts are mostly approximations based on a combination of criteria including topographic expression, stratigraphic context relative to the overlying, underlying, and laterally equivalent map units, and surface extrapolations of horizons interpreted in seismic data. The transgressive basal contact is poorly exposed, and may be gradational over several meters or tens of meters. Where the upper contact is observed in outcrop above the west bank of the Ivishak River about 1.3 km south of VABM Hak, marine rocks of the upper Schrader Bluff Formation grade into the overlying nonmarine facies of the Prince Creek Formation over several meters. On the north limb of the Kuparuk anticline along the Ivishak River near the east edge of the map area, a measured section of the most continuous exposures of the upper Schrader Bluff Formation yields an incomplete thickness of more than 830 m (2,730 ft) (D. LePain, oral communication, 2009), but the upper and lower contacts are not exposed. About 5 mi (8 km) downstream near VABM Hak, the Echooka Unit 1 well (fig. 4) drilled a vertical (apparent) thickness of more than 1,950 m (6,070 ft) of the upper Schrader Bluff Formation, but beds near the surface location dip 3050 degrees; the actual subsurface stratigraphic thickness is thus undoubtedly thinner, but lacking dip meter data, the true thickness is not well constrained. Perhaps the most reliable local thickness estimate for the upper Schrader Bluff comes from just north of the map area, where the Susie Unit 1 well (fig. 4) penetrated a subhorizontal section approximately 1,147 m (3,760 ft) thick (measured depth interval 8832,030 m [2,8976,661 ft]). Constraints on the age of the upper Schrader Bluff Formation in the map area are provided by Campanian palynomorphs on the south flank of the Kuparuk anticline along the Toolik River (Molenaar and others, 1984) and by late Campanian to possibly Maastrichtian Ar/Ar ages (70.8  0.9 Ma to 74.4  1.7 Ma; D.

At least two of these occurrences, along the Boonesborough and Eagle Nest faults, are replacement deposits (Black, 1971), of a type commonly associated with commercial sulfide ore bodies (Schwartz, 1955).  Such dolomite bodies adjacent to faults may be useful guides in exploration for sulphide ore.

Unit is exposed between Port Houghton and Windham Bay, described as an unnamed unit in Gehrels and others (1992), and referred to as the Windham Group in Gehrels (2002).  From base to top the unit consists of 1) dark gray to black phyllite, silvery gray phyllite, green and gray chloritic phyllite and semischist, light green to buff siliceous phyllite, 2) mafic flows and volcaniclastic rocks, 3) mafic volcaniclastic rocks, metagray wacke, rhythmically bedded black phyllite, and fine-grained felsic metatuff, and 4) metagraywacke, mafic metatuff, and metapelite.  The unit is dominantly clastic and lacks marble.  Metasedimentary rocks south of Windham Bay include conglomerate, graded sandstone, and sandstone-shale turbidites in sections tens of meters in thickness.  The conglomerate contains granitic cobbles up to 20 cm in dimension. The base of the unit is undetermined, and the unit appears to grade up into mafic metavolcanic rocks and marble of the Gastineau Group (Gehrels and others, 1992). The rocks contain pyrite, chlorite, muscovite, biotite, graphite, actinolite, garnet, feldspar, and quartz, and have been regionally metamorphosed to greenschist facies.  The unit underlies the Gastineau Group of Permian age, and is considered Permian or older (Gehrels and others, 1992). This unit is distinguished from the Kah Shakes unit near Ketchikan (Saleeby, 2000) (Pzsqm in this report) by the lack of marble and the lack of evidence for rocks with Early Devonian and older protolith ages. Twenty-eight detrital zircons from a sandstone south of Windham Bay yielded U-Pb ages between 369 and 387 Ma, with 3 additional grains at 1742, 1780, and 1965 Ma (Gehrels, 2002).  These rocks in this unit are included in the Taku terrane based on stratigraphic relations with the Gastineau and Perseverance Groups of the Taku terrane (Gehrels, 2002).  The rocks have zircon ages that are common in rocks of the Yukon Tanana terrane and are inferred to have detrital sources in common with the Yukon Tanana terrane (Gehrels, 2002). The rocks in the Taku terrane are distinguished from the Yukon Tanana terrane in that they apparently have older protolith zircon ages than the Yukon Tanana terrane (Saleeby, 2000), for which protolith zircon ages older than 373 Ma are not known (Dusel-Bacon and others, 2012).",,{metamorphic}

At one locality, the unit includes up to 20 m of maroon and green shale, with minor intercalated gray to black siliceous shale, and fine-grained calcareous sandstone and shale that locally contain Inoceramus fragments.   In Juneau area, graywacke, slate, and minor conglomerate; composed largely of volcanic debris, except for the conglomerates, which are polymictic and contain granitic clasts; most graywacke and slate were turbidites, but nothing more is known of the depositonal environment; weathers dark greenish gray, brownish gray, and very dark gray, graywacke and slate/argillite are locally calcareous and lighter colored; sedimentary structures common, although few directional features have been noted.  On Douglas Island this unit hosts the Treadwell ""albite diorite""sill, which is the host rock for the Treadwell gold deposits. On Admiralty Island, Graywacke turbidites, dark gray argillite, and polymictic conglomerate, with lenses of tuff and limestone.  Unit is dominantly dark gray to black slatey argillite.  Graywacke is commonly calcareous.  Limestones nodules and lenses to 50 cm thick are common in the argillite.  Graywacke contains dominantly feldspar, argillite, and volcanic rock fragments, but also contains quartz, detrital biotite, chert, epidote, and pyrite.  Conglomerate clasts include argillite, graywacke, limestone, marble, chert, quartz, felsite, mafic volcanic rocks, granitic rocks, and foliated metamorphic rocks.  Unit at least 2500 m thick.  At Cape Fanshaw (Gehrels and others, 1992), green to gray sandstone to siltstone graywacke layers ranging from several centimeters to several meters in thickness.  These layers are commonly separated by several centimeter thick layers of gray mudstone.  Graded beds and channels are common.  Many graywacke beds grade into conglomerate at their bases.  Clasts in conglomerate are dominated by intraformational shale, mudstone, graywacke, and limestone, and also include chert, feldspar porphyritic dacite(?), and granitoid rocks. Detrital zircon ages correlate with Yukon Tanana terrane zircon ages (Kapp and Gehrels, 1998). The graywacke grades up-section into thin-bedded siltstone-mudstone-shale turbidites.

In Ketchikan area, unit consists of basal conglomerate and grit that grade upward and laterally into slaty, dark gray, thin-bedded graywacke turbidites and minor limestone.  The conglomerate consists of poorly sorted angular to subrounded clasts, as much as a meter in maximum dimension, derived from stratigraphically underlying units, with a matrix of graywacke and grit.  On Annette Island and eastern Gravina Island consists of regionally metamorphosed greenschist facies flysch and minor intertonguing andesitic metatuff. Unit is gradationally more recrystallized and more deformed from west to east.  On Gravina Island (Berg, 1973), top of section is dark gray and brownish gray calcareous siltstone and argillite, and subordinate silty limestone, grit, pebbly to cobbly mudstone, and minor fine-grained intermediate volcanic rocks. Pebbly mudstone contains scattered clasts of altered quartz diorite. Satey cleavage; phyllitic.  Minimum 500 feet thick. Greenschist facies phyllite grades eastward to biotite schist.  Regional metamorphic fabric overprinted by low pressure metamorphism to pyroxene hornfels facies that occur in aureoles of Cretaceous and Tertiary plutons.  Late Cretaceous pluton aureoles contain quartz, feldspar, biotite, sericite, staurolite, andalusite, sillimanite, and garnet.  On the Chilkat Peninsula, prismatic shell fragments in flysch are inferred to represent the bivalve Inoceramus, and the rocks were assigned a tentative Jurassic and/or Cretaceous age (Plafker and others, 1989).  The flysch conformably overlies carbonate and chert of Upper Carnian to Upper Norian age.   On Admiralty Island Late Jurassic pelecypods, brachiopods, buchia, foraminifera, and dinoflagellate cysts.  Cretaceous brachiopods and ammonites.  40Ar/39Ar ages for detrital biotite in graywacke range from 80 to 160 Ma; and for detrital hornblendes in graywacke range from 88 to 120 Ma (Cohen and Lundberg, 1993).  Detrital zircons analyzed by Kapp and Gehrels (1998) yielded ages of 105-120 Ma, 140-165 Ma, 310-380 Ma, 400-450 Ma, 520-560 Ma, 920-1310 Ma, 1755-1955 Ma (Kapp and Gehrels. 1998).

56807,130,"Cape Ann Granite, alkali-feldspar quartz syenite",Cape Ann Granite,Ordovician,"Modal quartz content 5-15 percent (equivalent to nordmakite of Warren and McKinstry, 1924)","The principal rock of the map area is the Cape Ann Granite, an unfoliated, medium- to coarse-grained, leucocratic rock ranging in composition from quartzose alkali-feldspar granite, through alkali-feldspar quartz syenite, to alkali-feldspar syenite. Its texture is generally uneven, subhedral to subporphyritic, and locally cumulus. Crystals range from 0.5 to 1 cm (0.2 to 0.4 in.) long in the quartz-bearing rocks and are less uniform in the syenitic rocks. Most of the syenite is texturally equivalent to the granite, but the syenite commonly contains small, irregular pegmatitic patches that lack well-defined boundaries. The range (and median) of the principal minerals are: potassium feldspar, 53-85 (63) percent; plagioclase (An6-12), 0-22.5 (2.8) percent; quartz, 0-41 (24) percent; ferrohornblende, 0.1-17 (4.5) percent; biotite, 0-3.2 (0.8) percent; and opaque minerals, 0.2-7.5 (1.0) percent. Minor quantities of augite are in approximately one-quarter of the specimens. Accessory minerals include magnetite, ilmenite, zircon, apatite, and, very rarely, fluorite, pyrite or molybdenite. Carlsbad-twinned microcline microperthite is the dominant feldspar; less than 25 percent of the feldspar is homogeneous microcline. Plagioclase (albite or oligoclase) is present in only minor quantities. Quartz is clear, grayish, pinkish, or faintly smoky, shows weak strain shadows, and contains oriented sheets of dust-like inclusions and vesicles. Potassium feldspar and quartz occur as large single crystals and as clusters of subhedral to euhedral feldspar and anhedral quartz partly to completely surrounded by finer grained quartz and feldspar. The mafic minerals are variable in amount and appearance and occur as ragged clots, wisps, single subhedral crystals, and zoned reaction aggregates. Augite is colorless to pale green, typically occurring as a core that is partly or completely surrounded by pale-green amphibole, darker green sodium-iron amphibole, and reddish-brown biotite; magnetite granules are scattered throughout the aggregate. Sodium-iron amphibole and biotite occur as both isolated crystals and clots of both minerals. The mapped lithotypes of the Cape Ann Granite were determined by modal quartz content, because the amount of quartz in these subunits is consistent and varies smoothly in areas generally measurable in square kilometers (miles). Arbitrary divisions of 5, 15, and 25 volume percent of quartz were determined by point counts on outcrops. These lithotypes form irregular northeast-bending bands. Neither stratigraphic succession nor dips of these lithotypes is known, but field relations suggest the superposition of quartz-rich on quartz-poor types. The lithotypes probably originated by differential crystal settling, but may have had their origin in convective motions of the magma. Weathering causes sequential color changes in these felsic rocks from dark green to green gray or gray, then to brown, tan, and finally to white on exposed surfaces. The weathered surface is black-brown and grus is common under vegetation. Joints are commonly bordered by a brown zone a few centimeters (inches) thick. Xenoliths, which are generally small and well digested, but locally may retain their preincorporation character, are scattered throughout the intrusion. They include blocks of a fine-grained granite, probably the Squam Granite; Salem Gabbro-diorite and other fine-grained, commonly porphyritic mafic rocks; and siliceous metasedimentary rocks. Many of these latter were originally finely laminated (0.1 to 5 mm (0.004-0.2 in.)), but have been transformed by thermal metamorphism into thin-banded quartz-biotite rocks containing feldspars and hornblende. A few of these metasedimentary xenoliths contain muscovite, pyroxene, and garnet; one sample contains sillimanite.",{igneous}

50048,52,Lang Syne Formation,Lang Syne Formation,upper Paleocene,"Lang Syne Formation (Upper Paleocene) – The Lang Syne Formation is extremely variable in color, ranging from black to red to orange to gray to white to buff to brown. Lithologic variation is also extreme, ranging from thinly bedded, well-sorted clay to fine to medium sand with local clay-lined burrows to massive, variably sandy clay to iron oxide cemented sandstone and claystone to silicified claystone to Fuller’s Earth (Padgett, 1980). In updip areas the deposit tends to be sandier, while in downdip areas it tends to be more clayey. The base of the formation is often dominated by a subtle coarsening, though it is not always gravelly. Silicified shell hash containing abundant bivalves and turritellid gastropods is also locally present in the Gadsden, Wateree, and Eastover 7.5-minute quadrangles. This lithology is locally known as Buyck's (pronounced ‘Bikes’) Bluff chert or Black Mingo chert. It was used for projectile points by prehistoric people, even though it tends to be porous and of generally poor quality for knapping. Shell impressions are also sometimes found in the Fuller's earth beds. The clay, claystone, sandstone, and chert often form distinctive outcrops in road cuts, creek valleys, and river bluffs. Deposits of the Lang Syne Formation typically grade upwards into an extremely  cohesive, plastic, waxy, black, locally silty, lignitic, and micaceous clay with minor well-sorted, fine to medium sand in light-colored laminae. This top stratum, referred to as the “Tavern Creek bed,” makes a sharp contact with the loose sands of the overlying Congaree Formation and represents perhaps the best regional marker bed. Palynological analysis of black clay samples obtained from SCGS drill hole logs 40-94 and 40-104 indicated a late Paleocene (Thanetian) age and an early Paleocene (Danian) age, respectively (Willoughby, 2003). The Lang Syne Formation, which has been interpreted as a lower delta plain succession, is correlative with the Ellenton Formation on the Savannah River site, mixed carbonate-clastic sediment of the Rhems Formation in the subsurface of the Middle and Lower Coastal Plain of South Carolina, and the Aquia Formation of Virginia (Padgett, 1980; Nystrom and others, 1991).

This bed, referred to as the “Tavern Creek bed,” makes a sharp contact with the loose sand of the overlying Congaree Formation and grades downward into more variable deposits ranging from thinly bedded, well-sorted clay, fine to medium sand with local clay-lined burrows to massive, variably sandy, gray, orange, or white clay to iron oxide cemented sandstone and claystone to silicified claystone (Fuller's earth) (Padgett, 1980).

This outcrop probably is the farthest inland exposure of lime sediment in the Lang Syne Formation. GRI Source Map ID 5778 (Fort Motte Quadrangle). Lang Syne Formation (middle to upper Paleocene) – The Lang Syne Formation in Lone Star quadrangle is largely silty clay, clayey silt, and clayey or well sorted quartz sand. Silty clay matrix and minor clayey silt is very cohesive, softly plastic to hard, black, dark-gray, grayish-green to minor greenish-gray, and light tan; includes minor to moderate interspersed, well-sorted, very fine to fine quartz sand; includes minor interspersed, medium to coarse quartz sand; locally includes scattered, discrete, white laminae of very fine to fine quartz sand; commonly is micaceous; and locally includes black wood fragments, some of which have disseminated pyrite. Quartz sand is black, dark greenish-gray, gray, strong brown to light tannish-yellow, loose to very cohesive, and very fine to coarse; locally includes minor, scattered small quartz pebbles to 6 mm; locally includes moderate to abundant clay; locally is micaceous; locally includes scattered to abundant, green glauconite pellets; includes scattered dark heavy mineral grains; includes scattered laminae of well-sorted, very fine to fine quartz sand; includes minor to abundant interstitial clay; and includes minor greenish-gray clay laminae or thin beds; and varies locally to black clay matrix. Above the base of the Lang Syne in Lone Star quadrangle, quartz sand commonly is moderately to well sorted and very fine to medium. Black and dark brown, commonly pyritic lignite is common in drill holes in the Lang Syne Formation. Very cohesive, stiff, black clay locally grades to black quartz sand. Clay or sandy clay in the Lang Syne Formation weathers to a strong brown or burnt-orange color.  The Lang Syne Formation underlies all of Lone Star quadrangle except possibly the inland (northern) valley of Santee River, where the Lang Syne may have been removed by erosion. Nearly all auger holes in the quadrangle encountered some Lang Syne Formation. The greatest thickness of unit encountered in Lone Star quadrangle is 49 feet in drill hole 43-132. No drill holes in the quadrangle penetrated the complete stratigraphic thickness of the Lang Syne. In Lone Star quadrangle the Lang Syne Formation overlies the Sawdust Landing Formation, and abundant outcrops updip show that the relationship is unconformable. In Lone Star quadrangle the Lang Syne Formation unconformably underlies the Congaree Formation, the Warley Hill formation, the Orangeburg District bed, the Duplin Formation, the Marietta unit, the terrace unit of Low Falls Landing, eolian sand, or modern alluvium. The Lang Syne Formation correlates downdip with the Williamsburg Formation (Willoughby and others, 1999), which is Selandian and Thanetian (middle to upper Paleocene) in age (Weems and others, 2004). GRI Source Map ID 7336 (Lone Star Quadrangle). Lang Syne Formation (Paleocene) – The upper part of the Lang Syne Formation consists of thin and laterally continuous beds of yellowish, tan to brown, fine-medium-coarse grained micaceous quartz sand interlayered with beds of black clay that vary in thickness from 2 to 50 feet. The thin to very thick beds of black clay are Fuller’s Earth deposits that commonly occur near the top to middle of the formation and constitute entire exposures at some localities. Fuller’s Earth was historically mined from the Lang Syne Formation in this area; however, there are presently no active quarries. Multiple fining-upward sequences are common throughout the Lang Syne and are typically in sequences 10 to 20 feet thick. The Lang Syne Formation also contains beds of silicified shell hash and mudstone, which occur in numerous localities throughout Poinsett State Park. Exposures of these silicified shell hash beds occur at variable elevations and locations, and in most cases the outcrops are fragmented and likely to be influenced by mass wasting and other hill slope processes. Some of the silicified shell hash beds contain abundant chert deposits, which are dark and glassy and relatively gray to translucent. Chert cobbles are also present near the Lang Syne and Sawdust Landing contact on the weathered hill slopes in the vicinity of Poinsett State Park. Weakly silica-enriched and somewhat indurated claystone is a prominent part of the formation locally (Tavern Creek, Stop 3 in Nystrom and Willoughby, 1992). The Lang Syne Formation overlies the feldspathic clayey sand and sandy clay of the upper Cretaceous Sawdust Landing Formation. A prominent layer of well-rounded pebbles . to 3 inches in diameter occurs near this basal contact. In some exposures the pebbles in the basal bed are less abundant, and instead thin- to medium-bedded quartz sand occurs with scattered sand-size glauconite grains and thin beds of greenish-black marsh clay and locally, solitary corals. GRI Source Map ID 75216 (Poinsett State Park Quadrangle).  Lang Syne Formation (Paleocene) – Abruptly overlying the feldspathic, clayey sands and sandy clays of the Sawdust Landing Formation, a prominent layer of well-rounded pebbles occurs at places in the base of the Lang Syne Formation. In some exposures the pebbles in the basal bed are less abundant and thin to medium-bedded quartz sand occurs, with scattered to common sand-size glauconite grains, thin interbeds of black clay and, locally, solitary corals. Poorly sorted, medium- to very coarse-grained quartz sand with interspersed, locally abundant, fine- to coarse-grained glauconite overlies the pebble bed in numerous exposures. Above the basal meter or so, thin- to thick-bedded, locally clayey, quartzose sands with sand-size glauconite grains characterize the lower part of the Lang Syne Formation. The upper part of the Lang Syne Formation is comprised of characteristically thin and laterally continuous beds of micaceous, medium-grained quartz sand inter-layered with laminae or thin beds of black clay. Burrows are common in the sandy beds of the Lang Syne and in places have obliterated most of the original bedding. Some exposures include numerous impressions of mollusks. Stacked, thin beds to massive beds of black clay or Fuller's earth occur locally, commonly near the top of the formation, and constitute entire exposures at some localities. Weakly silica-enriched and somewhat indurated claystone is a prominent part of the formation locally (cf. Nystrom and Willoughby, 1992, Stop 3) and probably is related to replacement by secondary opal (Heron and others, 1965; Weaver and Wise, 1978; Prowell, 1990).

50063,52,Sawdust Landing Formation,Sawdust Landing Formation,upper Cretaceous,"Sawdust Landing Formation (Upper Cretaceous) – The Sawdust Landing Formation is composed of gray to cream to orange interbedded sand and clay that grades up into extremely stiff, extremely cohesive, variably steel-blue gray to cream (in fresh exposures) to red to white to orange to purple (in weathered exposures) clay with abundant, angular to subangular, medium to very coarse quartz, smoky quartz, rose quartz, and feldspar sand with minor heavy minerals, mica, lignite, and quartz and feldspar granules. This top stratum of tight, sandy, gritty clay is a very distinctive lithology and a good marker throughout much of the area. Although across the Santee River Valley to the east the base of the unit is often a lag deposit with a dark-green clay matrix (Prowell, 1990), the lower contact is more subtle in the study area and very similar to the underlying Upper Cretaceous deposits (e.g. Willoughby, 2003). The Sawdust Landing Formation, which was originally designated as the Sawdust Landing member of the Rhems Formation at a type locality at Sawdust Landing (also known as Trezvant's Landing) on the Santee River nearby, is interpreted as an Upper Delta Plain deposit (Muthig and Colquhoun, 1988; Nystrom and others, 1991). Though previously thought to be Paleocene in age, more recent data indicate that the Sawdust Landing Formation is late Cretaceous in age (Christopher and others, 1999).

Sawdust Landing Formation (Upper Cretaceous) – The top of the Sawdust Landing Formation, which is variably steel-blue gray to cream colored in fresh exposures and red to white to orange to purple in weathered exposures, is typified by extremely stiff, cohesive clay with abundant, angular to subangular, medium to very coarse quartz, smoky quartz, rose quartz, and feldspar sand with minor heavy minerals, mica, lignite, and quartz/feldspar granules. This sandy, gritty clay grades downward  (and locally laterally) to interbedded sand and clay. Although across the Santee River Valley to the east the base of the unit is often a lag deposit with a dark-green clay matrix (Prowell, 1990), the lower contact is more subtle in the study area and very similar to the underlying upper Cretaceous deposits (e.g. Willoughby, 2003).

Where clay is minor, the sediment is loose and incohesive. The Sawdust Landing Formation is considered to be late late Cretaceous in age (Christopher and Prowell, 2002). GRI Source Map ID 5778 (Fort Motte Quadrangle). Sawdust Landing Formation (Maastrichtian, Upper Cretaceous) – The Sawdust Landing Formation was tentatively identified by the writer in auger holes 9-11 and 9-21 in Lone Star quadrangle, and the formation was recognized in cores by Prowell (1990) in holes LM-1A, LM-2A, MAN-1A, Rimini-1A, and Railway 1A in Lone Star and Pinewood 7.5-minute quadrangles. In auger holes 9-11 and 9-21 in Lone Star quadrangle, sediments interpreted by the writer as Sawdust Landing Formation is white, lightgray, or light-tan, sandy clay, with fine to coarse quartz sand, locally with sparse pyrite or traces of carbonaceous material, and is lesser grayish-green, stiff to hard, silty clay. In outcrops updip from Lone Star quadrangle, the Sawdust Landing Formation is dominantly stiff, cohesive, light-gray to light greenish-gray, thick-bedded, massive to weakly cross-bedded, feldspathic, micaceous, clayey, quartzose sand with common quartz granules and quartz pebbles, to lesser light-gray sandy clay, micaceous clay, and cross-bedded, fine to very coarse quartz sand with white clay sand grains to pebbles and with laminae of heavy minerals (Nystrom and Willoughby, 1992). The Sawdust Landing Formation in core MAN-1A is characteristically dense, hard, massive to weakly crossbedded, thick beds of clayey, feldspathic, poorly sorted, angular, fine to coarse quartz sand to granules, and a variety of heavy minerals (Prowell, 1990). Christopher and Prowell (2003) considered the basal boundary of the Sawdust Landing Formation to be an unconformity. Fredriksen and others (2000) and (Christopher and Prowell, 2003) recently assigned a Maastrichtian, Late Cretaceous age to the Sawdust Landing Formation on the basis of sparse, included pollen grains. Previously the Sawdust Landing was interpreted to be of early Paleocene age. GRI Source Map ID 7336 (Lone Star Quadrangle). Sawdust Landing Formation (Upper Cretaceous) – The Sawdust Landing Formation consists primarily of light whitish-tan to gray to greenish gray, thick-bedded, massive to weakly cross-bedded, feldspathic, micaceous, clayey, fine to very coarse-grained quartz sand with common quartz granules and quartz pebbles. Other common lithologies include light-gray sandy micaceous clay, which is characteristically thick-bedded or may show no layering at all. Kaolin balls, kaolin clay coating, and abundant dark, fine- to coarse-grained heavy minerals are typically found scattered throughout the Sawdust Landing in the Poinsett State Park Quadrangle. The quartz-sand grains are generally angular, medium gray, and translucent to transparent. Red quartz is minor but noticeable. White to pink angular feldspar grains are common in most exposures and are up to an inch in length. Some sand beds have Abundant coarse flakes of mica. Better exposures may exhibit more than one sequence of clayey sand fining upward to sandy kaolinitic clay. Clay beds are generally light-gray but commonly display purple, pink, tan, or yellow mottles. On the basis of X-ray analyses, Prowell (1990) reported that the matrix clay of the unit is pale-green illite and smectite and gray to white kaolin. The illite and smectite clay is mainly confined to the upper part of the unit. Accessory minerals recognized include ilmenite, siderite, garnet, leucoxene, zircon, pyrite, rutile, sillimanite, biotite, tourmaline, monazite, rutilated quartz, cristobalite, and other opaque heavy minerals (Prowell, 1990).

Sawdust Landing Formation (Upper Cretaceous) – The Sawdust Landing Formation primarily consists of light gray to light greenish gray, thick-bedded, massive to weakly cross-bedded, feldspathic, micaceous, clayey, quartzose sand with common quartz granules and quartz pebbles. Other common lithologies include light gray sandy clay and micaceous clay, which are characteristically thick-bedded or may show no layering at all. A less common lithology is prominently cross-bedded, fine- to very coarse-grained quartzose sand with white clay grains, clay balls and with very thin streaks of dark heavy minerals. The quartz sand grains in the unit are generally angular, medium-gray, and translucent to transparent. Red quartz is minor but noticeable. White to pink, angular feldspar grains are common in most exposures and are up to an inch in length. Some sand beds have abundant, coarse mica. Better exposures may exhibit more than one sequence of clayey sands fining upward to sandy kaolinitic clay. Clay beds are generally light gray but commonly display purple, tan or yellow mottles. The Sawdust Landing Formation is stiff, cohesive, and difficult to penetrate with a power auger. The dense, thick-bedded, clayey sand, sandy clay and clay of the unit along with the characteristic feldspars distinguish the Sawdust Landing Formation from other units in the section. On the basis of X-ray analyses, Prowell (1990) reported that the matrix clays of the unit are pale green illite/smectite and gray to white kaolin, and that the illite/smectite clays are mainly confined to the upper part of the unit. He also found small amounts of cristobalite in the matrix. Accessory minerals recognized include ilmenite, siderite, garnet, leucoxene, zircon, pyrite, rutile, sillimanite, biotite, tourmaline, monazite, rutilated quartz, and opaque heavy minerals.

Feldspar, mica, pyrite, and phosphatic fragments are minor sand constituents. Locally, very micaceous (mostly green chlorite) with sparse carbonized wood fragments. Fine-grained pyrite abundant throughout formation. Local thin, pebbly zones with large fossil impressions occur in the middle of the formation. In the upper part of the formation, quartz increases to about 40 percent. Unit crops out in a narrow belt throughout the map area and forms isolated outliers in the central sheet. Best exposures are along Crosswicks Creek in the Allentown quadrangle. In the southern sheet, the Marshalltown underlies a narrow belt in the uplands and broadens to the southwest. Many Marshalltown exposures occur along Oldmans Creek and its tributaries near Auburn, Gloucester County. The contact with the underlying Englishtown Formation is sharp and unconformable. The basal few centimeters of the Marshalltown contain siderite concentrations, clay balls, and wood fragments reworked from the underlying Englishtown. Many burrows, some filled with glauconite, project downward into the Englishtown for about one meter (3 ft) giving a spotted appearance to the upper part of the Englishtown (Owens and others, 1970). The Marshalltown is the basal transgressive unit of a sedimentation cycle that includes the regressive deposits of the overlying Wenonah and Mount Laurel Formations resembling the overlying Red Bank Formation to Navesink Formation cycle in its asymmetry.  Within the map area, only a few long-ranging megafossils occur in the Moorestown quadrangle (Richards, 1967).

50125,54,Granite,,Jurassic,"Several large Jurassic plutons of diverse composition occur in the northern and southern Snake Range. This group of plutons is represented in the Wheeler Peak Quadrangle by the Snake Creek/Williams Canyon pluton. A variety of isotopic geochronologic techniques, including U-Pb analyses of monazite and Sr whole rock analyses, yield an intrusive age of approximately 160 Ma for this body (Lee et al., 1986). The elongate, undeformed Snake Creek/Williams Canyon pluton is oriented roughly E-W with a larger eastern lobe in Snake Creek and has a total exposed area of 35 km2 (Lee et al., 1984; 1986). It is a compositionally zoned calc-alkaline pluton from a biotite-tonalite (63% SiO2) to the east grading into a biotite-granite (76% SiO2) to the west (Lee et al., 1986). The most mafic compositions are represented by rounded, cognate biotite-rich granodiorite xenoliths ranging in diameter from 3-15 cm, found throughout the pluton. Accessory minerals in the eastern portion of the pluton include biotite, epidote, titanite, magnetite, and allanite, whereas the central and western portions locally include garnet, ilmenite, and monazite primarily in aplite/pegmatite dikes and in felsic border phase rocks; apatite and zircon are ubiquitous throughout (Lee and Van Loenen, 1971). Within 10-20 m of the country rock contact, muscovite is often present together with or in place of biotite. West of Pyramid Peak in the Wheeler Peak quadrangle, extensive areas of the intrusion have been altered to a pyrite-muscovite quartz griesen, labeled Jgra on Plate 1A, associated with abundant quartz veins. These 0.05-5-meter-thick quartz veins strike approximately N60E, are steeply dipping, and have steeply plunging slickensides (Fig.9). They often contain the mineral assemblage muscovite-galena-wolframite (Smith, 1976). A hornblende-bearing, fine- grained granodiorite dike was mapped east of Pyramid Peak, and garnet-bearing aplite dikes are often found cutting the pluton near its contact with the country rock. Occasionally, somewhat more porphyritic equivalents of the pluton are found as dikes and in some parts of the pluton itself. In these, quartz, biotite, and plagioclase occur as phenocryst phases. The Snake Creek/Williams Canyon pluton has a sharp intrusive contact with the several units that surround it, including the Precambrian McCoy Creek Group Quartzite and the Osceola Argillite, and the Cambrian Prospect Mountain Quartzite, Pioche Shale, and Pole Canyon Limestone. Contact effects include the growth of muscovite, chlorite, biotite, and aluminum silicate minerals within argillaceous layers and calc-silicate minerals within calcareous layers. Pervasive retrogression of schists and slates prevents conclusive identification of the aluminum silicate porhyroblasts that grew in the aureole of the pluton, but euhedral outlines allow identification of the pseudomorphs as staurolite. Staurolite porphyroblasts increase in size and quality towards the pluton. Grey, elongate, prismatic grains with square cross-sections were tentatively identified in the field as andalusite, and other retrograded aluminum silicate porphyroblasts may include chloritoid and/or cordierite. Skarn assemblages in calc- silicate rocks include epidote, garnet, diopside, and actinolite. Metamorphic grade in the contact aureole rises from greenschist to amphibolite facies over horizontal distances of less than 1.5 km (McGrewandMiller,1993). In addition to the observed growth of certain minerals in the aureole of the granite, a penetrative cleavage is developed in pelitic units adjacent to the pluton. Systematic observation of the relationship of cleavage development to growth of contact metamorphic minerals indicate the two are coeval and that deformation was synchronous with granite emplacement (Miller, et al., 1988). This cleavage is discussed in more detail elsewhere in the text (source report). (OF93).",,"{igneous,metamorphic,sedimentary}"

56808,130,"Cape Ann Granite, alkali-feldspar syenite",Cape Ann Granite,Ordovician,"Modal quartz content less than 5 percent (equivalent to Beverly Syenite of Clapp, 1910, 1921)","The principal rock of the map area is the Cape Ann Granite, an unfoliated, medium- to coarse-grained, leucocratic rock ranging in composition from quartzose alkali-feldspar granite, through alkali-feldspar quartz syenite, to alkali-feldspar syenite. Its texture is generally uneven, subhedral to subporphyritic, and locally cumulus. Crystals range from 0.5 to 1 cm (0.2 to 0.4 in.) long in the quartz-bearing rocks and are less uniform in the syenitic rocks. Most of the syenite is texturally equivalent to the granite, but the syenite commonly contains small, irregular pegmatitic patches that lack well-defined boundaries. The range (and median) of the principal minerals are: potassium feldspar, 53-85 (63) percent; plagioclase (An6-12), 0-22.5 (2.8) percent; quartz, 0-41 (24) percent; ferrohornblende, 0.1-17 (4.5) percent; biotite, 0-3.2 (0.8) percent; and opaque minerals, 0.2-7.5 (1.0) percent. Minor quantities of augite are in approximately one-quarter of the specimens. Accessory minerals include magnetite, ilmenite, zircon, apatite, and, very rarely, fluorite, pyrite or molybdenite. Carlsbad-twinned microcline microperthite is the dominant feldspar; less than 25 percent of the feldspar is homogeneous microcline. Plagioclase (albite or oligoclase) is present in only minor quantities. Quartz is clear, grayish, pinkish, or faintly smoky, shows weak strain shadows, and contains oriented sheets of dust-like inclusions and vesicles. Potassium feldspar and quartz occur as large single crystals and as clusters of subhedral to euhedral feldspar and anhedral quartz partly to completely surrounded by finer grained quartz and feldspar. The mafic minerals are variable in amount and appearance and occur as ragged clots, wisps, single subhedral crystals, and zoned reaction aggregates. Augite is colorless to pale green, typically occurring as a core that is partly or completely surrounded by pale-green amphibole, darker green sodium-iron amphibole, and reddish-brown biotite; magnetite granules are scattered throughout the aggregate. Sodium-iron amphibole and biotite occur as both isolated crystals and clots of both minerals. The mapped lithotypes of the Cape Ann Granite were determined by modal quartz content, because the amount of quartz in these subunits is consistent and varies smoothly in areas generally measurable in square kilometers (miles). Arbitrary divisions of 5, 15, and 25 volume percent of quartz were determined by point counts on outcrops. These lithotypes form irregular northeast-bending bands. Neither stratigraphic succession nor dips of these lithotypes is known, but field relations suggest the superposition of quartz-rich on quartz-poor types. The lithotypes probably originated by differential crystal settling, but may have had their origin in convective motions of the magma. Weathering causes sequential color changes in these felsic rocks from dark green to green gray or gray, then to brown, tan, and finally to white on exposed surfaces. The weathered surface is black-brown and grus is common under vegetation. Joints are commonly bordered by a brown zone a few centimeters (inches) thick. Xenoliths, which are generally small and well digested, but locally may retain their preincorporation character, are scattered throughout the intrusion. They include blocks of a fine-grained granite, probably the Squam Granite; Salem Gabbro-diorite and other fine-grained, commonly porphyritic mafic rocks; and siliceous metasedimentary rocks. Many of these latter were originally finely laminated (0.1 to 5 mm (0.004-0.2 in.)), but have been transformed by thermal metamorphism into thin-banded quartz-biotite rocks containing feldspars and hornblende. A few of these metasedimentary xenoliths contain muscovite, pyroxene, and garnet; one sample contains sillimanite.",{igneous}

36344,22,Hyden Formation,Hyden Formation,Middle Pennsylvanian,"Taylor coal bed is persistent throughout the mapped area.  It is generally 3 feet thick but locally as thick as 4 1/2 feet, and in the northeastern part of the mapped area coal as thick as 7 1/2 feet has been mined in the Taylor seam.  The Taylor thins where the upper part of the coal grades into overlying carbonaceous shale.  This waxy carbonaceous shale is very resistant to weathering, and its easily spotted float forms an important guide to prospecting for the Taylor coal.  The Taylor-Magoffin zone generally forms a prominent bench, which also aids in locating the coal. \nLargely sandstone, some shale: sandstone units as much as 120 feet thick, generally more crossbedded and coarser grained in the lower part; separated by lenticular units of medium- and medium-dark-gray shale 1 to 25 feet thick. \nCoal: Fire Clay coal bed is characterized by a discontinuous parting of flint clay, medium-brownish-gray to dark brownish-gray and locally nearly white, ranging in thickness from 0 to 6 inches or a little more.  The Fire Clay coal is commonly split into 3 or 4 coal beds ranging in thickness from 1/2 foot to 2 feet, separated by partings of shale or underclay ranging in thickness from less than an inch to as much as 5 feet.  Locally some beds coalesce to form a single bed of economic thickness.  Very rarely the upper beds nearly join the lower beds to form a coal zone 8 to 12 feet thick; at such localities the seam is known as the ""Big Dirty"" coal.  Overlying sandstone units locally cut out the upper beds of the Fire Clay coal zone, but nowhere is the entire coal zone missing. Fire Clay rider coal bed occurs 25 to 50 feet above the Fire Clay coal, is discontinuous, and is generally less than 2 feet but locally as much as 4 feet thick.  A discontinuous coal bed as much a s 11/2 feet thick occurs 30 to 60 feet above the Fire Clay ride, coal bed; it is generally in 2 splits, each 3 to 6 inches thick. \nSandstone and shale: upper part largely sandstone, fine- to medium-grained; units are as much as 50 feet thick, are separated by lenticular units of medium-gray to medium dark-gray shale 1 to 15 feet thick, and have sharp disconformable basal contacts with underlying shales and coals.  Lower part of interval, to top of the Williamson coal bed, is a single unit 40 to 80 feet thick-the Kendrick Shale of Jillson (1919); it consists largely of shale and calcareous shale with silty-limestone concretions, interstratified with a few thin to very thin fine-grained sandstone beds.  Sideritic nodules and nodular bedding are everywhere present and marine and brackish-water fossils are locally present. Williamson coal at nearly all exposures is from 3 to 4 feet thick; but its thickness ranges from 2 to 7 feet.  It is characterized by an unusually high content of sulfur (2-4 percent); the sulfur is in pyrite, which occurs in lenses concentrated near the top and bottom of the seam and as thin films coating cleat surfaces.  Owing to a persistent sandstone unit closely underlying the base of the Williamson coal, the Williamson-Kendrick interval forms a wide, generally persistent bench. \nCoal: the coal bed 70 to 100 feet above the Williamson is thin and discontinuous.

Mapping and new biostratigraphic data gathered in the last 30 years have shown that many of these rocks mapped only as Devonian also contain Early Mississippian fossils, thus making it difficult to distinguish them from known lithologically similar Lower Mississippian rocks. Although this unit is everywhere structurally bounded by faults, a stratigraphic link to older Slope assemblage rocks is possible. These rocks are imbricated with units DCs, IPMcl, OCc, Ocq, DSt, Dc, and MDcl. Whether there is a definable continuous Early Mississippian through Devonian sequence within this unit is unknown, but is suggested in the Carlin-Piñon Range (Smith and Ketner, 1978). The Slaven Chert first described in the Shoshone Range (Gilluly and Gates, 1965) is black chert with carbonaceous shale beds 4–10 feet thick, limy brown-weathering sandstone as much as four ft thick with coarse fragments of chert, shale, greenstone, limestone, graywacke, feldspathic siltstone, and brown-weathering limestone 2–20 ft thick, and contains Late Devonian radiolarians (Boundy-Sanders, Sandberg, and others, 1999). The Mississippian Waterpipe Canyon Formation is a similar formation with basal medium-grained graywacke with interlayered black, carbonaceous shale; chert-pebble conglomerate; and bedded chert grading upward into sandstone layers with black, well-rounded quartz and a black, pyritic, phosphate- and barite-bearing, argillaceous matrix interlayered with black, platy, quartz siltstone and fine-grained graywacke interbeds. It contains Early Mississippian radiolarians (Peters, Armstrong, and others, 2003). In the HD Range in northeastern Elko County, an undated, light-gray weathering, brittle, black shale, structurally underlies the other thrust sheets and was referred to as the Chainman Shale by Riva (1970), but is included here in unit MDst. In the Windermere Hills a fissile black argillite with sporadic interbeds of quartz-chert arenite is poorly exposed with variable dips suggesting a complex structure (Oversby, 1972). In the Cockalorum Wash quadrangle along the Eureka-Nye County boundary, a pale yellow-brown, organic-detrital limestone contains quartz and chert grains locally interbedded with and succeeded upward by light-colored siliceous mudstone, claystone, and siltstone. The basal limestone contains mixed Mississippian and Devonian faunas; a thin chert from a higher zone has Osagean radiolarians (Hose, 1983). In the northern Adobe Range, this unit is recognized as dark siliceous rocks consisting of shale, argillite, and bedded chert. They are faulted and folded with sparse collections of Kinderhookian and Famennian radiolarians and conodonts (Ketner and Ross, 1990). The Webb Formation in the Carlin-Piñon Range is a gray siliceous mudstone with black to gray, tan-weathering, dense limestone in lenses near the top (Smith and Ketner, 1978). The argillite of Lee Canyon is a black siliceous argillite with a little black chert and very little conglomerate and sandstone near the top (Smith and Ketner, 1978). In the Sulphur Spring Range, the Bruffey sequence (Carlisle and Nelson, 1990) is a black chert pebble to boulder conglomerate and well-bedded gritty limestone, chert and limestone conglomerate, gray limy shale, and minor sandstone. Smith and Ketner (1978) describe the same rocks as gray limestone, sandy limestone, chert, and chert-pebble conglomerate. The Woodruff Formation from the same area is described by Carlisle and Nelson (1990) as a gray fissile shale, dolomitic siltstone, and black and brown bedded chert. Smith and Ketner (1978) describe the Woodruff as dark gray to black siliceous mudstone and chert, with lesser amounts of shale, siltstone, dolomitic siltstone, dolomite, and limestone. In the Shoshone Range, pale-red to pale-brown weathering, platy, silty dolomite interbedded with black chert in the basal 50 ft of rocks referred to as the Pilot Shale by both Gilluly and Gates (1965) and Wrucke (1974) is included here. In the southern Independence Range, this unit consists of fine-grained limestone, bedded chert, shale, conglomerate, and prominent ledges of limy sandstone with Famennian and Frasnian (Late Devonian) conodonts (Ketner, 1998). In Welches Canyon northwest of Carlin, this unit is gray to black limestone, fine grained, and thin to thick bedded with common sand- and silt-size clasts of quartz and chert grains. It also contains pebbles and cobbles of chert, and interlayered chert and siliceous shale as much as 50 feet thick (Evans, 1974). In the Snake Mountains, the unit is dark carbonaceous limestone apparently overlain by a light-gray, siliceous platy siltstone. Other outcrops that belong with unit MDst, but are not mapped separately on a regional scale from Slope or Basin assemblage units DCs and DOts include the Pinecone sequence in the Toquima Range (Coles and Snyder, 1985), and gold-bearing chert (Theodore, T., oral commun., 2006) mapped informally as the “Rodeo Creek Formation” (Peters, 1997b) in the Carlin area.","Original map source: Crafford, A.E.J., 2007, Geologic Map of Nevada: U.S. Geological Survey Data Series 249, 1 CD-ROM, 46 p., 1 plate; Scale 1:250,000.","{metamorphic,sedimentary}"

55830,119,Arkansas Novaculite,Arkansas Novaculite,Late Devonian to Early Mississippian,"Three informal divisions of the Arkansas Novaculite are recognized: The lower division is white to dark-gray cryptocrystalline quartz. Fine-grained novaculite is translucent on thin edges and is harder and denser than opaque coarser-grained novaculite. Bedding is massive, 4 to 30 feet (1.2-9.1 m) thick, with interbedded gray shales, minor amounts of sandstone and conglomerate near the base. Bedding planes are locally very flat and can be confused with joint planes. A hummocky surface was also common. On Glazypeau Mountain the lower novaculite pinches out, and when present, sandstone is encountered at the base. The lower division is a prominent ridge former, is approximately 275 feet (84 m) thick in Hot Springs and thickens in the Trap Mountains to 450 feet (137 m). The middle division is typically dark-gray to black siliceous shale interbedded with numerous thin beds of dark novaculite and chert. In the Zigzag Mountains the novaculite and chert beds are generally less than two inches thick, but in the Trap Mountains they range from 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) thick. Thin- to thick-bedded quartz arenite sandstone resembling the Hot Springs Sandstone is present in the Trap Mountains in Lake Catherine State Park. This division reaches a maximum thickness of 80 feet (0-24 m) in the Zigzag Mountains and 100 to 300 feet (30-91 m) in the Trap Mountains. The contact with the lower division is sharp. Locally this division is totally or partially replaced by conglomerate. The upper division is white, thin- bedded novaculite interbedded with soft, white shale and is typically calcareous and tripolitic. Thicker beds of novaculite at the top of this division resemble the lower member with beds are up to 4 feet thick. This unit becomes thin-bedded in the Glazypeau Mountain area and resembles the Bigfork Chert. Thickness of the upper division reaches a maximum of 160 feet (0-49 m) in Hot Springs and 100 feet (0-30 m) in the Trap Mountains. The contact with the Stanley Shale and/or Hot Springs Sandstone is unconformable. Locally, the upper and/or middle divisions are eroded and replaced by conglomerate. Grain size of the novaculite averages about 5 microns (Holbrook and Stone, 1978). Conglomerates with novaculite clasts occur at various intervals in the formation and are deposited by granular-grain flows that form beds several inches thick to boulder-clast flows several feet thick. The novaculites are 99 percent silica with the remaining one percent predominantly pyrite and/or FeMn-bearing calcite (J.M. Howard, per. comm., 2010). Many quartz veins occur within the novaculite, but are too small to observe in outcrop. This unit and the Hot Springs Sandstone compose the backbone of the Zigzag Mountains in the Hot Springs area. The estimated total thickness of the Arkansas Novaculite in the Hot Springs area is 400 feet (122 m) and reaches 600 feet (183 m) in the Trap Mountains. Flow indicators include ripples marks, distributary channel features and thickening to the south. The contact with the middle division of the Arkansas Novaculite is unconformable and often marked by a conglomerate or breccia.

33983,22,Ashlock Formation,Ashlock Formation,Upper Ordovician,"Limestone in eastern part of outcrop area, grades laterally northeastward into dolomite.  Limestone is of two varieties: 1) light to medium gray, nodular to indistinctly bedded; composed of whole fossils and large fossil fragments, chiefly bryozoans and brachiopods, in a fine bioclastic groundmass, with some gray shale as partings and thin interbeds; and 2) yellow brownish gray to grayish brown, weathering very light gray, micrograined, containing abundant ostracodes and some cephalopods, in thin tabular beds locally thickening to smooth-surfaced bulbous masses.  In most outcrops the nodular variety occurs in upper part but also occurs in lower part where it is interbedded with ostracodal micro-grained variety.  Limestone grades northwestward into ledge-forming, ferruginous dolomite similar to that of Preachersville Member; zone of transition fairly well exposed along sides of ridge between Indian Creek and the Red River Road.  Where basal beds are limestone, contact with underlying dolomitic shale is sharp; where basal beds are dolomite, the member is gradational with underlying unit, and contact placed at base of ledge-forming dolomite beds. \nEconomic (minerals): Anomalous bodies of dolomite occur at five localities in the quadrangle; they appear to be genetically related to faulting.  At least two of these occurrences, along the Boonesborough and Eagle Nest faults, are replacement deposits (Black, 1971), of a type commonly associated with commercial sulfide ore bodies (Schwartz, 1955).  Such dolomite bodies adjacent to faults may be useful guides in exploration for sulphide ore.  In the Boonesborough fault body, otherwise calcitic rocks of the Calloway Creek Limestone, Garrard Siltstone, and at least the upper 41 feet of the Clays Ferry Formation are dolomitized to a total drilling depth of 194 feet at the U. S. G. S. Allen No. 1 core hole site.  In the southeastern part of this quadrangle, and in the adjacent Hedges quadrangle, dolomite has replaced limestone of the Reba Member of the Ashlock Formation in a narrow elongate zone adjacent to the Eagle Nest fault.  Both outcrops and the drill core contain, as cavity fillings and replacements, small quantities of barite, pyrite, coarsely crystalline calcite, and dolomite; and, in dolomite of the Reba, sphalerite.  In the three grabens in the western part of the quadrangle north of the Boonesborough fault, neither field relations nor fossil evidence were sufficient to determine if the dolomite occurrences resulted from alteration of country rock, or if dolomitic strata higher in the stratigraphic section were downdropped by faults. \nTERRILL MEMBER USGS Unit Info: GEOLEX (id: 4085)   Dolomitic shale, moderate-grayish-green, olive-gray, and light-greenish-gray; fissile where weathered, some beds blocky with subconchoidal fracture where fresh.

A few thin, even-surfaced beds of brownish-gray calcarenite and calcirudite are widely spaced throughout member.  Least common limestone type is very light gray to light brownish gray, micrograined to cryptograined, commonly ostracode bearing; some beds contain small sparry calcite-filled tubes; occurs in two zones within member: 1) zone within 10 feet of base consists of a few thin beds of micrograined limestone: 2) zone in upper part is as much as 12 feet thick, base mapped locally as a line, similar in lithology and stratigraphic position to and may be correlative with the Gilbert Member of the Ashlock Formation (G. W. Weir, oral communication) as mapped in southern Madison County (Greene, 1966, 1967) but not mapped on intervening quadrangles.  Member commonly grades downward through an interval of several feet from indistinctly bedded, somewhat dolomitic limestone to more evenly bedded dolomitic shale of underlying member; contact placed on top of dominantly dolomitic shale. \nTATE MEMBER USGS Unit Info: not available   Dolomitic shale and limestone: Dolomitic shale, olive-gray to light-grayish-green, silty, calcareous, in even-surfaced beds and laminae, moderately to poorly fissile with blocky subconchoidal fracture.

Outcrops close to zone of dolomitization south of Boonesborough fault contain beds of resistant dolomite similar to types common to that zone; member may be present, as dolomite, on highest hills in dolomitized zone.  Basal contact generally sharp; base locally gradational through a few feet. \nBACK BED USGS Unit Info: GEOLEX (id: 223)   Limestone is greenish gray, weathers light yellowish brown; fine grained, dolomitic, fossiliferous; in irregular thin beds; occurs chiefly in Back Bed which is as much as 7 feet thick in southern part, present as a few limy, fossiliferous beds or absent in northern exposures, underlain by and apparently grades laterally into dolomitic shale.",Oa; Winchester Quadrangle (GQ-1159) | http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsweb/PubsSearching/MoreInfo.asp?titleInput=306 | Map description and column: http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsmap/kgsgeoserver/geolDescID.asp?idType=pointID&fmcode=361ALCK&gq_num=1159&map_level=24K,{sedimentary}

86908,245,West Baden Group,West Baden Group,"Mississippian, Chesterian","The West Baden Group consists of five named formations described in descending order. The Elwren Formation is variably composed of horizontal- to cross-bedded fine-grained to very fine grained sandstone, bioturbated black shale, massive to lenticular-bedded bioturbated siltstone, and mudstone. Predominant lithology at any one locality may be sandstone, siltstone, or shale. Sandstones are generally shades of gray, siltstones are dark gray to greenish-gray and infrequently maroon, and shales are black. Measurements from cores indicate a thickness range of 39 to 59 ft. The Reelsville Limestone is discontinuous and found only in a few cores; it consists of a massive- to horizontal-bedded grainstone that is fossiliferous to oolitic and pinkish gray. Thickness ranges from less than 1 ft to more than 8 ft. The Sample Formation is dominantly a cross- to ripple- and wavy-bedded, fine-grained to very fine grained sandstone that may also be horizontal- and flaser-bedded. Color is often orange to yellowish-gray or tannish-gray that weathers to a dark purple. Cross-bedded sandstones are generally slightly coarser, up to medium-grained sand. The remainder of the formation is dominantly a dark gray to black shale and minor mudstone and siltstone. Thickness is highly variable, often depending on the amount of sandstone present, and ranges from 10 to 51 ft. The Beaver Bend Limestone consists of skeletal grainstone to packstone with occasional argillaceous limestone beds. Recognizable fossils include crinoids and occasional bryozoans and brachiopods. It may be locally oolitic in part. Color is variable from yellowish-tannish-gray to medium pinkish-gray to dark brownish-gray or dark gray. Thickness ranges from 11 to 22 ft, but is commonly about 15 ft. The Bethel Formation is dominantly either dark gray to black shale, containing occasional thin sandstone laminae and scattered small pyrite nodules or dark gray to black lenticular to interlaminated, bioturbated siltstone. Wavy or ripple-bedded to cross-bedded fine-grained to very fine grained sandstone forms about one-third to one-quarter of the unit, generally in the upper part, but occasional thin sandstones can also be found near the base. Sandstones range from light to dark gray. Siltstone can be locally prominent. A thin coal is present at one locality. Thickness is variable from 10 to 37 ft.

On bedding plane surfaces, cracks are generally discontinuous and sinuous, occurring isolated but parallel, or as three-pointed stars (ìbirds foot cracksî), with concave-up argillite between. Less diagnostic components are dark, bluish-gray silty dolomite in beds 1-5 dm thick with molar-tooth calcite ribbons, uneven graded couplets of pale green siltite and calcitic argillite, and white, pyritiferous, very fine-grained calcitic quartzite in 1-5 dm beds, some with hummocky cross stratification.

Calcite and barite as replacements and fillings locally occur in some beds.  At a few localities lowest few inches of basal bed includes disseminated granule- to coarse sand-size grains of quartz and chert in dolomite.  Lower two-thirds of unit generally consists of thick-bedded, dense, very resistant dolomite which commonly forms scarp exposures and overhangs shallow undercuts in underlying dolomitic shale; upper third is slightly less resistant, thinner bedded, and is composed of porous-weathering, earthy, ferruginous dolomite similar to dolomite in the Crab Orchard and Drakes Formations.  Some beds fossiliferous, especially in upper part; cogwheel-shaped crinoid segments and, at three locations, the brachiopod Whitfieldella, used by earlier workers to define the upper contact (Foerste, 1906), occur within 1 to 3 feet of the base of the overlying shale unit, which is commonly marked by a slight topographic bench.  Basal contact sharp. \nEconomic (minerals): A northwest-striking vein, chiefly of barite and as much as 3 feet thick, occurs along the northeastern fault of the northwest-trending graben that crosses Dry Fork in the southwestern part of the quadrangle.  No barite was found below an elevation roughly coincident with the top of the Brannon Member of the Lexington Limestone on the upthrown side, and the top of Tanglewood Limestone Member on the downthrown side.  Coarsely crystalline calcite and barite cavity fillings and replacements occur sparsely in the Brassfield Dolomite.  Small inclusions of calcite, barite, dolomite, sphalerite, and pyrite were found in dolomitized parts of the Reba Member of the Ashlock Formation in this and the adjacent Winchester quadrangle (Black, 1974).  The abrupt change from limestone to dolomite in these beds, the increase in degree of alteration toward the faults, and the areal distribution of dolomitized rock adjacent to faults suggest that the faults were conduits for dolomitizing solutions.  Such solutions may have deposited materials of economic value at greater depth. \nStructure: Structural relief on the base of the Brassfield Dolomite is about 270 feet in the area of outcrop.  Of this, more than 70 feet can be attributed to movement after deposition of Silurian rocks and prior to deposition of that part of the New Albany Shale above the basal dolomite beds.",Scb; Hedges Quadrangle (GQ-1235) | http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsweb/PubsSearching/MoreInfo.asp?titleInput=343 | Map description and column: http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsmap/kgsgeoserver/geolDescID.asp?idType=pointID&fmcode=357COBR&gq_num=1235&map_level=24K,{sedimentary}

Limestone, less than 15 percent, similar to that of upper part of formation; bioclastic limestone of classes 1 and 2 (of Weiss and Norman, 1960b) dominant in upper two-thirds of unit, argillaceous limestone of class 3 is less common, silty calcarenite and calcilutite of classes 5 and 6 are rare except in lower part of unit.  Thin (3 to 6 inches) unevenly tabular beds of nodular limestone with calcilutite nodules, in an argillaceous bioclastic matrix (class 7) locally present. Siltstone, about one percent of unit, medium-gray, calcareous, nonfossiliferous, uniform in texture, present as discrete tabular beds as much as 7 inches thick and as commonly laminated and crosslaminated layers generally less than 1 inch thick within shale, most common in lower three-fifths of unit.  Base conformable and well defined. Whole and broken small fossils in limestone of classes 1 to 3 and shale of the Kope Formation include bryozoans (Dekayella, Hallopora, Escharopora, and Batostoma), brachiopods (dalmanellid brachiopods in upper unit and Grand Avenue Member, Sowerbyella in lower unit, Zygospira, and Lingula?), crinoid columnals, broken trilobites (Cryptolithus and Isotelus in lower unit, and Flexicalymene), and graptolites (Climacograptus) in lower unit. \nEconomic (limestone): Limestone has been quarried from the Fairview Formation and Bellevue Tongue of the Grant Lake Limestone in the Devou Park area.  The Fairview Formation and to a lesser extent other Ordovician formations have been quarried, generally in small borrow pits and cuts where conveniently situated for highway fill, along Interstate 75 and between Taylor Mill and Forest Hills.  Shale and silty limestone of the lower and middle parts of the Kope Formation have been used as nearby sources of riprap and highway fill at the mouth of Dry Creek and in the vicinity of Bromley. \nEconomic (petroleum): The area is largely untested for oil and gas.  Test holes were drilled near the mouth of Dry Creek and north of Erlanger for fuel storage studies.  The Latonia refinery well was drilled for disposal of liquid wastes. \nEconomic (clay, sand, gravel): Lenses of crosslaminated high-grade silica sand within the pre-Illinoian outwash deposits have been used for foundry molding sand (Leverett, 1929, p. 12; McFarlan, 1943, p. 424).  Many of these deposits now underlie housing developments. \nEconomic (clay, sand, gravel): Sand and gravel of the Ohio River bed and flood plain have been dredged for concrete aggregate and road metal, and screened sand has been used for castings.  Present commercial sources now lie beyond the quadrangle boundaries. \nEconomic (clay, sand, gravel): Clay from deposits of Wisconsin and Holocene age along the Ohio River and the lower part of the Licking River, especially from terrace deposits, and residual clay from the Kope Formation are suitable for the manufacture of common brick and drain tile (Fermeman, 1916, p. 179-180; McFarlan, 1943, p. 396). \nGeotechnical: Much of the Kope Formation, particularly the lower part, is soft, easily deformed shale. Oversteepened banks and artificial cuts are subject to slumping and require adequate drainage and shoring.  Similar conditions may exist in clay-rich portions of Quaternary units.  Highway fill containing appreciable quantities of shale and argillaceous limestone from Upper Ordovician formations is subject to failure by sliding. \nGRAND AVENUE MEMBER USGS Unit Info: GEOLEX (id: 1849)   Interbedded shale and limestone: Shale, 55 to 65 percent, medium-light-gray to greenish-gray, commonly laminated and fissile, in beds less than 2 to about 16 inches thick; commonly slightly calcareous and silty, generally fossil poor.

Springs issue from their base directly above the Osgood Formation and Waldron Shale. Non-saline ground water is difficult to obtain from the area underlain by the Borden in the western part of the area, except from local shallow wells in the Muldraugh Member or the Harrodsburg Limestone.  Some water is available from gravel lenses near the base of the lacustrine deposits. (See also Palmquist and Hall, 1960.) \nLand-Use: The quadrangle is in an area of rapid suburban residential development owing to its proximity to Louisville.  Because of the lack of permeability in the Borden Formation, New Albany Shale, and lacustrine deposits, and because of solution cavities in the carbonate units to the east, most of the mapped area is unsuited for septic tank or cesspool methods of sewage disposal.

36342,22,Hyden Formation,Hyden Formation,Middle Pennsylvanian,"Delbarton Quad The Taylor coal bed is largely banded bright and dull attritus; lenses and films of pyrite common; bed generally exceeds 30 inches in thickness but splits and thin partings of clay are common and a bench of impure (argillaceous) coal some 4 to 8 inches thick occurs near the top at many localities. \nDelbarton Quad: The Hamlin coal beds are extremely variable in thickness and number of partings.  The Fire Clay coal bed contains a parting of flint clay as much as 4 inches thick.  A parting of flint clay as much as 4 inches thick also occurs locally in the uppermost bed shown in the Whitesburg coal zone.  Because the Whitesburg and the Fire Clay beds occur close together and have very similar lithologic associations the two are easily confused.  The occurrence of flint clay in the two seams can be observed in prospects near the head of Maynard Branch at altitudes of 1,190 and 1,230 feet respectively.  The flint-clay-bearing coal bed in the Whitesburg coal zone of this report is likely the Whitesburg coal bed of the adjacent Williamson quadrangle (Alvord and Trent, 1962), and probably is the ""Little Fire Clay"" coal bed of other quadrangles (Outerbridge, 1964; Alvord, 1965a; Jenkins, 1967); it is the principal bed of the Whitesburg coal zone in the Pikeville quadrangle (Alvord, 1965b). The Williamson coal bed, called Williamson-Thacker seam by local miners, is 40 to 70 inches in total thickness including bone and claystone partings; 28 to 40 inches in a single unsplit bed occurs within seam at most localities; bands, films, and lenses of pyrite are common. \nBREATHITT FORMATION USGS Unit Info: GEOLEX (id: 618)   Coal beds between the Taylor and Williamson coal beds are in general very thin, discontinuous, and badly split by beds of claystone.

Grayish-red, grayish-purple, and dark-brownish-red sequences (Trlr) occur in some places, especially in upper half. Two types of cycles are recognized: freshwater-lake (detrital) and alkaline-lake (chemical) cycles. Freshwater-lake cycles average 5.2 m (17 ft) thick. They consist of basal, transgressive, fluvial to lake-margin deposits that are argillaceous, very fine grained sandstone to coarse siltstone with indistinct lamination, planar or cross lamination, or are disrupted by convolute bedding, desiccation cracks, root casts, soil-ped casts, and tubes. Medial lake-bottom deposits are laminated siltstones, silty mudstones, or silty limestones that are dark gray to black with calcite laminae and grains and lenses, or streaks of pyrite; fossils are common, including fish scales and articulated fish, conchostracans, plants, spores, and pollen. Upper regressive lake margin, playa lake, and mudflat deposits are light- to dark-gray silty mudstone to argillitic siltstone or very fine grained sandstone, mostly thick bedded to massive, with desiccation cracks, intraformational breccias, faint wavy laminations, burrows, euhedral pyrite grains, and dolomite or calcite specks.  Alkaline-lake cycles are similar to freshwater-lake cycles, but are thinner, averaging 3 m (10 ft), have fewer fossils (mainly conchostracans), and commonly have red beds, extensive desiccation features, and abundant analcime and dolomite specks in the upper parts of cycles.

Mica, feldspar, and pyrite are minor sand constituents. Very micaceous at base. Locally, has extensive iron incrustations in near-surface weathered beds. Fossil molds are mostly phosphatic. Fossils typically occur in siderite concretions. No calcareous fossils were found in outcrop. The Merchantville forms a continuous narrow to wide belt throughout the map area. The unit is about 6 m (20 ft) thick in the northern part of the central sheet, about 20 m (66 ft) thick in the Trenton area, and 12 to 15 m (39-49 ft) thick throughout the southern sheet.  The formation is best exposed in the Trenton East quadrangle, mainly in the tributaries on the western side of Blacks Creek and south of Bordentown, Burlington County, where the entire thickness of the formation can be seen in gullies (Owens and Minard, 1964b). The basal contact with the underlying Magothy or Cheesequake Formations is sharp and disconformable. At most places, a reworked zone about 0.3 to 1 m (1-3 ft) thick is present at the base. This basal bed contains reworked lignitized wood, siderite concretions as much as 13 cm (5 in) in diameter, scattered pebbles and coarse-grained quartz sand and is burrowed. Most burrows project downward into the underlying formations. The Merchantville is the basal bed of a lower Campanian transgressive-regressive cycle that includes the overlying Woodbury and Englishtown Formations. Merchantville faunas were analyzed by Sohl (in Owens and others, 1977) who concluded that northern fauna represented deposition on a lower shoreface or in the transition to an inner shelf, whereas the southern fauna was a deeper water assemblage, probably inner shelf.  Macrofossils occur as internal and external molds and include the ammonites Menabites (Delawarella) delawarensis and Scaphites (Scaphites) hippocrepis III. The Scaphites is of the type III variety of Cobban (1969) and is indicative of the lower, but not the lowest, Campanian. More recently, Kennedy and Cobban (1993), detailing the ammonite assemblage that includes Baculites haresi, Chesapeakella nodatum, Cryptotexanites paedomorphicus sp., Glyptoxoceras sp., Menabites (Delawarella) delawarensis, M.

Basal contact generally sharp and well defined; placed so as to separate dominantly shale sequence of basal part of unit from the underlying, locally ledge-forming, dominantly limestone sequence at top of lower part of Clays Ferry.  In southern and much of eastern parts of quadrangle, this lithologic distinction is largely lost, an appropriate base can no longer be mapped with certainty, and the two-fold division of the Clays Ferry is replaced by undivided Clays Ferry.  Locally, unit directly overlies both tongues of Tanglewood Limestone Member of Lexington Limestone, and basal contact is sharp where well exposed. \nCLAYS FERRY FORMATION, LOWER PART USGS Unit Info: not available   Lower part of Clays Ferry Formation and Point Pleasant Tongue.  Limestone and shale: Limestone (more than 65 percent) in three major types: (1) fossil-fragmental limestone, medium- to medium-light-gray and light-brownish- and pinkish-gray, coarse- to fine-grained, locally sparry; beds 2 inches to as much as 5 feet thick, lenticular to tabular, irregularly to evenly layered; locally crossbedded, particularly in upper part of Point Pleasant; locally para-rippled; pyrite clusters and grains, limonite-stained, locally present as blebs on bedding surfaces and along fine fractures; beds form low cliffs where closely spaced; locally weather nodular and rubbly; (2) slightly phosphatic calcarenite, medium-bluish-gray to medium-gray, medium- to fine-grained; beds commonly graded, more evenly tabular than those of type 1, range from 1 to 8 inches in thickness; and (3) generally fossil-poor, argillaceous and silty limestone, medium- to medium-dark-gray and olive-gray, fine-grained to micrograined; locally laminated, bedding characteristics similar to limestone of type 2.  Beds of type 1 mainly in upper part of unit; beds of type 3 dominate lower part; beds of type 2 present throughout unit.  Intraformational conglomerate locally common at or near top, chiefly in Point Pleasant; consists of subrounded to subangular fragments of fine-grained argillaceous limestone in a coarser grained bioclastic limestone matrix.  Ledge-forming lenses as much as 10 feet thick, dominantly of type 1 limestone with thin shale interbeds, present at or near top of unit and in some lower zones; locally underlain by pinching and swelling, contorted and flow-rolled beds of fine- to medium-grained limestone.  Shale, medium-dark-gray to medium- and brownish-gray, laminated, calcareous and slightly silty, generally sparsely fossiliferous; as irregular partings and mottlings in limestone and as discrete beds generally less than 6 inches, rarely more than 15 inches thick.  Shale is locally abundant in zones as much as 5 feet thick above or, less commonly, below Tanglewood tongues.  One of these zones, 11 feet above the lower Tanglewood tongue, is well exposed 1.75 miles west-northwest of Milford along Ky. Highway 539.  Whole and broken fossils abundant in limestone of type 1 and in some other limestone beds; include bryozoans, brachiopods (dalmanellids, Rafinesquina, Zygospira), trilobites (Isotelus fragments in upper part), high- and low-spired gastropods in some thin argillaceous limestone beds, particularly in lower part, crinoid columnals, particularly in upper part, and cephalopods.  Base of zone abundant Sowerbyella lies above Point Pleasant Tongue; it lies above to as much as 10 feet below top of lower part of Clays Ferry, and as much as 45 feet below top of the undivided Clays Ferry.  Unit resistant, commonly well exposed in streams, cuts, and steep slopes.  Point Pleasant Tongue is 110 to 120 feet thick; lower part of Clays Ferry is as much as 135 feet thick; thickness figures include intercalated tongues of Tanglewood where present.  Lower contact commonly well exposed, placed at base of sequence of interbedded subtabular to tabular, generally argillaceous limestone and shale beds.  Contacts with both Tanglewood tongues are sharp; contact with Grier Limestone Member of Lexington Limestone locally sharp, generally gradational and slightly interfingering in vertical interval of less than 10 feet.  At places in southwestern part of quadrangle, as along Stony Creek, and along Harrison Creek and Ky. Highway 1284 near elevation 623, interval between base of lower Tanglewood tongue and the Grier consists locally of limestone-rich strata of mixed rock types resulting from interfingering of Tanglewood, Clays Ferry, and Grier; these strata are mapped with the most appropriate adjoining unit.  Change in nomenclature from Clays Ferry Formation of central Kentucky to Point Pleasant Tongue of Clays Ferry Formation of northern Kentucky made in this quadrangle, as in quadrangles to the west (Luft, 1974, 1975), along an arbitrary line marking the northern pinchout of mappable and continuous outcrop of the upper part of the Clays Ferry that directly overlies the lower part of the Clays Ferry.  The Point Pleasant Tongue was called the Point Pleasant Formation prior to publication of the Lawrenceville quadrangle (Swadley, 1975).",Ocf; Claysville Quadrangle (GQ-1341) | http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsweb/PubsSearching/MoreInfo.asp?titleInput=410 | Map description and column: http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsmap/kgsgeoserver/geolDescID.asp?idType=pointID&fmcode=361CLFR&gq_num=1341&map_level=24K,{sedimentary}

Secondary unit description from USGS Geologic Names lexicon (ref. NY046): Hanover Shale Member of Java Formation is uppermost unit in area containing fossils of the Frasnian Stage. Unit is 28 m thick and composed primarily of green-gray mudstone with accessory discrete thin black shale beds and zones of small calcareous, phosphatic and pyritic nodules. Usually very bioturbated, but contains few shelly fossils. The Hanover changes eastward into siltier, upslope deposits of the Wiscoy Member southeast of the type section at Java Village. Fossils include a mixture of benthic and pelagic fossils, goniatites and carbonized driftwood fragments. Small rugose corals and crinoid ossicles also occur. The Frasnian-Famennian stage boundary position has been tentatively placed several meters below the top of this unit by Kirchgasser (pers. comm. 1989).In outcrop in western NY, the Java consists of a basal black shale, the Pipe Creek Shale Member, and an overlying gray shale and mudrock with scattered beds of black shale and siltstone, and abundant limestone nodules, the Hanover Shale Member. The Pipe Creek thins to the east and feathers out in northern Stuben Co. The Hanover, however, thickens to the east and grades laterally into the Wiscoy Sandstone Member. The Pipe Creek rarely exceeds 25 ft in thickness, but makes up much of the radioactive black shale in the Java. In the subsurface, it extends south from western NY about 450 mi to Scott Co., VA. It thins to a featheredge in OH, KY, and TN. The Hanover is recognizable in the subsurface southward from western NY to eastern KY and adjacent southwestern VA and northeastern TN. Where the Pipe Creek pinches out, the Hanover cannot be separated from the Angola Shale Member of the West Falls Formation. The two grade westward into the upper part of the Olentangy Shale in central OH, and in central TN, the combined shales are equivalent to the upper unit of the Dowelltown Member of the Chattanooga Shale. Original map source: NYS Museum, NYS Geological Survey, NYS Museum Technology Center, 1999, bedrock geology of NYS data is distributed in ARC/INFOr EXPORT format (with '.e00' extension) in 5 seperate files based on 1970 printed map sheets, scale 1:250,000.",{sedimentary}

Other coal beds are generally thin or absent, thickest in southwestern part of quadrangle.  Lowermost coal bed may be equivalent to Hindman coal bed (Hodge, 1908, p. 43); however, the Lost Creek Limestone of Morse (1931) that generally occurs above the Hindman has not been identified in this quadrangle. \nSandstone, siltstone, shale, and coal: Rock types generally similar to those in the two overlying units; sandstone is well indurated and very thick bedded, containing fine horizontal lamination.  The Fugate coal bed is composed of moderately bright attritus with abundant thin vitrain bands; generally thickest in south half of quadrangle.  The Oakley coal zone, 14 to 67 feet below the Fugate coal bed, is composed of two coal beds separated by about 10 feet of carbonaceous shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone.  The Oakley coal beds are composed mostly of sparse to moderately abundant thin to medium-thick vitrain bands in a dull to moderately bright attritus; partings of carbonaceous shale and hard streaks of impure coal commonly occur in upper part of lower coal bed.  What is probably the upper coal bed crops out east of Flat Branch of Quicksand Creek, west of Wolf Creek, and west of Richie Branch of Little Caney Creek.  The lower coal bed is generally persistent and has been prospected at many places in the quadrangle; it is probably equivalent to the Hazard No. 7 coal bed of Perry County (Williamson and Adkison, 1953; Welch, 1958, p. 596).  The Fugate and Oakley coal beds are included in the Peach Orchard coal zone of the Tiptop quadrangle (Danilchik, 1977) to the east; the lower bed of the Oakley coal zone is probably equivalent to the Nickell coal bed of the Quicksand quadrangle (Donnell and Johnston, 1963) to the west. \nSiltstone, sandstone, shale, coal, and limestone: Rock types generally similar to those described above except that in lower part sandstone contains thin to very thick layers of even to lenticularly bedded, clayey to sandy limestone; shale in the Prater coal zone commonly contains scattered small ironstone concretions.

The upper coal bed is dominantly carbonaceous shale intercalated with thin vitrain in a dull attrital matrix.  The lower coal bed has sparse medium to thick vitrain bands in an attrital matrix that is usually dull, but at places is bright; shale partings common.  In south-central part of quadrangle, the Prater zone is chiefly very carbonaceous shale containing a thin blocky and bright coal bed.  The lower coal bed of the zone is equivalent to the Hazard coal bed of adjacent areas to the south and southwest (Williamson and Adkison, 1953; Mixon, 1965), and to the Adele coal bed of the Quicksand quadrangle (Donnell and Johnston, 1963) to the west. \nSiltstone, sandstone, shale, coal, and limestone: Siltstone and sandstone generally similar to those rock types described above.

56805,130,"Cape Ann Granite, alkali-feldspar granite",Cape Ann Granite,Ordovician,Modal quartz content 15-25 percent,"The principal rock of the map area is the Cape Ann Granite, an unfoliated, medium- to coarse-grained, leucocratic rock ranging in composition from quartzose alkali-feldspar granite, through alkali-feldspar quartz syenite, to alkali-feldspar syenite. Its texture is generally uneven, subhedral to subporphyritic, and locally cumulus. Crystals range from 0.5 to 1 cm (0.2 to 0.4 in.) long in the quartz-bearing rocks and are less uniform in the syenitic rocks. Most of the syenite is texturally equivalent to the granite, but the syenite commonly contains small, irregular pegmatitic patches that lack well-defined boundaries. The range (and median) of the principal minerals are: potassium feldspar, 53-85 (63) percent; plagioclase (An6-12), 0-22.5 (2.8) percent; quartz, 0-41 (24) percent; ferrohornblende, 0.1-17 (4.5) percent; biotite, 0-3.2 (0.8) percent; and opaque minerals, 0.2-7.5 (1.0) percent. Minor quantities of augite are in approximately one-quarter of the specimens. Accessory minerals include magnetite, ilmenite, zircon, apatite, and, very rarely, fluorite, pyrite or molybdenite. Carlsbad-twinned microcline microperthite is the dominant feldspar; less than 25 percent of the feldspar is homogeneous microcline. Plagioclase (albite or oligoclase) is present in only minor quantities. Quartz is clear, grayish, pinkish, or faintly smoky, shows weak strain shadows, and contains oriented sheets of dust-like inclusions and vesicles. Potassium feldspar and quartz occur as large single crystals and as clusters of subhedral to euhedral feldspar and anhedral quartz partly to completely surrounded by finer grained quartz and feldspar. The mafic minerals are variable in amount and appearance and occur as ragged clots, wisps, single subhedral crystals, and zoned reaction aggregates. Augite is colorless to pale green, typically occurring as a core that is partly or completely surrounded by pale-green amphibole, darker green sodium-iron amphibole, and reddish-brown biotite; magnetite granules are scattered throughout the aggregate. Sodium-iron amphibole and biotite occur as both isolated crystals and clots of both minerals. The mapped lithotypes of the Cape Ann Granite were determined by modal quartz content, because the amount of quartz in these subunits is consistent and varies smoothly in areas generally measurable in square kilometers (miles). Arbitrary divisions of 5, 15, and 25 volume percent of quartz were determined by point counts on outcrops. These lithotypes form irregular northeast-bending bands. Neither stratigraphic succession nor dips of these lithotypes is known, but field relations suggest the superposition of quartz-rich on quartz-poor types. The lithotypes probably originated by differential crystal settling, but may have had their origin in convective motions of the magma. Weathering causes sequential color changes in these felsic rocks from dark green to green gray or gray, then to brown, tan, and finally to white on exposed surfaces. The weathered surface is black-brown and grus is common under vegetation. Joints are commonly bordered by a brown zone a few centimeters (inches) thick. Xenoliths, which are generally small and well digested, but locally may retain their preincorporation character, are scattered throughout the intrusion. They include blocks of a fine-grained granite, probably the Squam Granite; Salem Gabbro-diorite and other fine-grained, commonly porphyritic mafic rocks; and siliceous metasedimentary rocks. Many of these latter were originally finely laminated (0.1 to 5 mm (0.004-0.2 in.)), but have been transformed by thermal metamorphism into thin-banded quartz-biotite rocks containing feldspars and hornblende. A few of these metasedimentary xenoliths contain muscovite, pyroxene, and garnet; one sample contains sillimanite.",{igneous}

Dolomitized fossils common as casts, abundant in some layers, include brachiopods, horn corals, colonial corals (including halysitid corals), and algal mat remains. Shale near base is greenish gray to dark greenish gray, non-calcareous. Contact with underlying shale commonly distinct on steep hillsides; poorly exposed and partly inferred on broad rolling uplands near Mount Washington, Soils developed an this unit include Crider, Russellville, and Dickson Series (Zimmerman, 1966). Residuum generally 5 to 12 feet thick on uplands. \nEconomic (limestone): Limestone and dolomite for aggregate, agricultural purposes, road metal, subgrade, and fill are obtained from the Laurel Dolomite in two pits in the quarry along Cedar Creek near the north quadrangle boundary.  Analyses of the middle and upper parts of the Laurel in this quarry give 51 to 58 percent CaC03,28 to 39 percent MgC03, 1 to 5.5 percent other oxides, and 3 to 11 percent insolubles (Kentucky Department of Highways, 1959, p. 52).  Dimension stone is also quarried intermittently from the upper ledges of the Laurel in a small pit above Floyds Fork about half a mile south of Oak Grove Church.  The Laurel has also been worked in several small quarries, now abandoned.  The Louisville Limestone and the Saluda Dolomite Member of the Drakes Formation have each supported at least one quarry.  Most of the abandoned quarries have probably furnished road metal and fill. \nEconomic (petroleum): Gas for domestic use is reported to have been furnished for several years by a well, now abandoned and no longer evident, about half a mile north-northeast of Oak Grove Church.  A natural blowout of gas in the early 1950s at the mouth of Mulberry Run in the southeastern part of the quadrangle is reported to have been followed by three or four days during which gas bubbles were seen rising from rock crevices in the creek.

78381,133,Columbia pluton,,Ordovician,"Light-gray, medium- to coarse grained, foliated. Includes biotite-muscovite granite, granodiorite, tonalite, and granitic pegmatite; contains xenoliths of biotite gneiss, amphibolite, and felsic metavolcanic rocks. Mineralogy: plagioclase + quartz + microcline; common accessories include biotite, muscovite, epidote, zircon, apatite, garnet, magnetite, and pyrite (Bourland and Glover, 1979). Geophysical signature: diffuse magnetic lows and radiometric highs. The pluton was originally named Columbia Granite by Jonas (1928); this name was objected to by later workers because of the relatively small percentage of true granite present. The pluton includes the southeastern portion of the granodiorite unit of Smith and others (1964). Granitic rocks in the Carysbrook area of Fluvanna County are here considered part of a separate Carysbrook pluton, following the usage of Stose and Stose (1948). The Columbia includes, in part, the Hatcher complex of Brown (1969). Bourland and Glover (1979) refer to the pluton as the Columbia metagranite. Given the heterogeneous nature of the pluton, multiple intrusive phases are likely present.  Tonalite in the eastern part of the pluton has yielded ages of 590+/-80 Ma, (Rb-Sr whole-rock; Fullagar, 1971). Mose and Nagel (1982) report a Rb-Sr whole-rock age for the Columbia of 454±9 Ma. Because samples for this age are described as coming from the western portion of the Columbia, it is possible that the rocks dated were taken from what is herein mapped as the Carysbrook pluton (grc).","Central Virginia Volcanic-Plutonic Belt, Changed from Columbia Granite to Columbia Pluton (Karen Hostettler) Original map source: Virginia Division of Mineral Resources, 2003, Digital Representation of the 1993 Geologic Map of Virginia, Publication 174, CD ROM (ISO-9660) contains image file, expanded explanation in pdf, and ESRI shapefiles, scale 1:500,000.",{igneous}

In Juneau area, moderately to poorly foliated and layered medium to coarse grained hornblende gneiss with lesser amounts of hornblende and biotite schist; weathers greenish gray or grayish green, dark greenish gray fresh; crops out as irregular and elongate masses (Brew and Ford, 1985).  In Port Houghton area, unit consists dominantly of mafic and quartzofeldspathic schists derived from basaltic, rhyolitic, and probably dacitic volcanic rocks; biotite schist derived from pelitic strata, quartzite derived from quartz-rich clastic strata, and marble. Quartz-porphyritic metarhyolite with large blue quartz phenocrysts in a centimeter scale fragmental texture is a diagnostic rock type.  Metarhyolite is commonly interlayered with metabasalt that displays  fragmental and pillow structures.  In general the proportion of metavolcanic rocks increases upsection (southwestward).  In the lower part of the section, metaclastic quartzite and quartz-cobble conglomerate are common (Gehrels and others, 1992). In Petersburg area, gray, fine- to coarse-grained, banded quartz-biotite and hornblende-plagioclase gneiss. Foliated, lineated, locally proto mylonitic or phyllonitic. Dominantly quartz-biotite-feldspar gneiss with schistose layers, and locally contains garnet and/or hornblende (Karl and others, 1999). In Blake Channel and western Bradfield Canal, unit includes undifferentiated Port Houghton and Endicott assemblage protoliths, based on Brew and others (1984), and McClelland and Mattinson (2000).  In Ketchikan area, unit includes  quartzofeldspathic biotite schist and gneiss, quartz-muscovite semischist, calc-schist, marble, and quartzofeldspathic biotite-amphibole gneiss. Metamorphic minerals include quartz, plagioclase, chlorite, epidote-clinozoisite, biotite, muscovite, actinolite, hornblende, garnet, kyanite, calcite, and pyrite.

37867,22,Porters Creek Clay,Porters Creek Clay,Tertiary,"Clay and sand: Clay, light-gray to greenish-black, brown streaks locally, commonly weathered to light colors beneath gravel.  X-ray analyses of typical clay showed approximately 10 percent quartz, 70 percent clay consisting predominantly of calcium montmorillonite and subordinately of illite and kaolinite, 10 percent clinoptilolite, and 5 percent gypsum1.  Clay is micaceous, glauconitic and sandy in part; has conchoidal fracture; weathers into chips and blocks; anomalous occurrence of carbonized and pyritized wood at fossil locality B.  Sand, greenish-gray, pale yellowish-brown; weathers bright red where highly glauconitic, very fine to fine quartz, clayey; medium to coarse glauconite grains commonly sparse to very abundant; micaceous; sand occurs as thin beds in lower part and is dominant in upper part, particularly near Hendron and Forest Hill.  A single sand dike in clay near upper contact was mapped about 1 mile southeast of Lone Oak; sand is composed of reddish-brown medium to coarse quartz unlike sand of Porters Creek Clay but similar to basal Wilcox sand. Relationship indicates dike sand was derived from above in contrast to sand in dikes attributed by Glenn (1906, P. 30-31), to injection from below. According to R. H. Tschudy (written communications, 1963, 1964) samples of clay from fossil localities B, C, D, H, I, J, and K (D3418) yielded pollen such as Chenopodiaceae, Taxodiaceaepollenites, Momipites, Alnus, and Pinuspollenites that indicate a Paleocene age.  Tschudy further points out that the abundance of dinoflagellates, hystrichospheres, and Micryhystridium, commonly well sorted as to size, suggests marine deposition some distance from shore.  Samples from fossil locality N yielded foraminifera of Paleocene age (S. M. Herrick, written communication, 1961).  According to Druid Wilson (written communication, 1963) a sample of sand collected by W. W. Olive from fossil locality E yielded species of the pelecypod genera Nucula, Nuculana, Cucullaea, Verericor, "" Tellina"", and Cuspidaria, and of the gastropod genera ""Natica"" and Volutocorbis cf. V. rugatus (Conrad), which is a strictly marine fauna of Paleocene or early Eocene age.  Base of unit is placed beneath lowest clay bed that exhibits conchoidal fracture.  Base of unit is unconformable at Metropolis, where glauconitic clay of the Porters Creek contains a few clay and white chert pebbles at the base (probably Owl Creek or Clayton of Pryor and Ross, 1962, tables 9 and 10) and lies on thinly laminated lignitic silty clay and sand believed to be McNairy Formation (probably Levings Member of Pryor and Ross (1962, table 5; see pollen dating below) of the McNairy Formation).

Silt is yellowish brown generally becoming medium to dark-gray at depths below 10 feet, argillaceous, micaceous; sparingly to abundantly fossiliferous; contains small quantities of angular to spherical fine to medium sand, coal particles, vivianite, and chert and quartz pebbles.  Locally calcareous at depths below 8 feet south of Tennessee River, and rarely calcareous north of river; irregular-shaped calcareous concretions as much as 1 inch across occur in exposures along Garrison Creek and along left bank of Ohio River at mouth of Island Creek.  Generally 50 or more feet thick beneath broad alluvial plain south of Tennessee River, and 20 feet or less thick north of river.  Most silt below altitude of 355 feet is probably lacustrine in origin, derived in part from loess which fell into a lake (Finch and others, 1964) during late Pleistocene time and in part from loessal silts transported by streams pouring into the lake.  Sand is moderate yellowish brown, silty, usually micaceous; consists of angular to well-rounded quartz and chert grains; contains dark minerals and particles of bituminous coal in various amounts; sand generally fine near surface, becoming coarser with depth.  Occurs as thin lenses in silt south of Tennessee River and as narrow levee deposits along bank of Tennessee River.  As much as 40 feet of fine sand grading downward into fine to coarse sand penetrated in holes drilled between Tennessee and Ohio Rivers.  Gravel or gravelly sand and silt, penetrated in test holes, occur at depths of 30 to 85 feet below lacustrine deposits in the areas between Clarks River and Island Creek and between Ohio and Tennessee Rivers.  Within these areas upper limit of gravelly sediments ranges between 250 and 300 feet in altitude.  Gravel mostly consists of chert and quartz granules and pebbles; south of Tennessee River in an argillaceous, sandy, medium-gray silt matrix; north of the Tennessee matrix is fine to very coarse sand.  Both north and south of the Tennessee, sand consists chiefly of quartz, chert, mica, coal, and magnetite with authigenic vivianite.

A similar suite was obtained from a sample recovered from a depth of 135 feet (altitude 191 feet) in a hole drilled in Illinois 1/4 mile north of Ohio River at eastern quadrangle boundary.  These sediments were derived from glacial outwash.  The relatively low altitudes at which they occur and the absence of similar deposits in other wells in the area suggest they were transported into the area by floodwaters of the Ohio River at a time when the Ohio occupied the Cache River Lowland (Fisk, 1944, p~ 26, fig. 32) 15 to 20 miles to the north.  Gravel ridges with concordant crests at altitude of about 355 feet bordering upland areas were deposited as a spit and as beach deposits and offshore bars in a lake (Finch and others, 1964) that occupied a part of western Kentucky and southern Illinois.  Two well-rounded possibly ice-rafted cobbles, one of silica-cemented sandstone and the other of aplitic quartz that contains very sparse magnetite and biotite, each about 10 inches long, were found at the base of alluvium east of Clarks River near Mile 5.

Upper contact locally iron stained by oxidized pyrite.  Intertongues at base with Grier Limestone Member.  Contacts poorly exposed over large areas, mainly projected in southeastern part of quadrangle.  Cavernous; sinkholes and solution-widened joints common.  Uppermost beds locally contain stromatoporoids. \nHydrology: Subsurface flow of water is partly controlled by solution-widened fractures and by flat openings at contacts between major rock units (MacQuown, 1967, p. 59-61).  In the absence of shale and bentonite, water can move freely for great distances.  Alinements of solution-enlarged fractures, sinkholes, caverns, and depressions commonly indicate fracture zones followed by subsurface watercourses (Palmquist and Hall, 1961, p. 23).  Solution by ground water produced numerous sinkholes and caverns in the brittle Perryville and the fragmented Tanglewood and Grier Limestone Members.  Several historic high-yield springs occur within the Grier Limestone Member.  The intersection of a northwesterly-trending shearing zone with the cr bed of the Grier provides a channelway for water issuing at Shawnee Springs.  Shawnee Run Spring is fed by a channelway formed by a northwesterly-trending shear zone that intersects the base of the Grier.  Boiling Spring at Harrodsburg is at the top of the Grier.  Numerous high-yield springs occur at the base of the Macedonia Bed and cr bed of the Grier and at the top of the Tyrone Limestone in the drainage of Shawnee Run and Shaker Creek.  The most favorable location for water wells is at the intersection of solution-widened joints, which can be detected by the alignment of sinkholes and related depressions.  Best results are obtained where wells are drilled to the cr bed or to the top of the Tyrone Limestone.  Water from wells deeper than 100 feet may contain salt and hydrogen sulphide (Palmquist and Hall, 1961, p. 28-29).  Details of groundwater conditions were reported by Hall and Palmquist (1960) and Palmquist and Hall (1960).",Olt1; Harrodsburg Quadrangle (GQ-1020) | http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsweb/PubsSearching/MoreInfo.asp?titleInput=239 | Map description and column: http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsmap/kgsgeoserver/geolDescID.asp?idType=pointID&fmcode=365TLGD1&gq_num=1020&map_level=24K,{sedimentary}

80479,133,Magothy Formation,Magothy Formation,Santonian,"Sand, quartz, fine- to coarse-grained, locally gravelly (especially at the base), white; weathers yellow brown or orange brown, interbedded with thin-bedded clay or dark-gray clay-silt mainly at the top of the formation. Muscovite and feldspar are minor sand constituents. Large wood fragments occur in many clay layers. Clay weathers to gray brown or white. Formation characterized by local vertical and lateral facies changes. The Magothy is best exposed and thickest (about 80 m (262 ft)) in the Raritan Bay area. The outcrop belt is widest in the north and narrows to the southwest. The formation is about 25 m (82 ft) thick or less in the southern sheet. The formation is poorly exposed because of its sandy nature and its widespread cover by younger sediments.  The old geologic map of New Jersey (Lewis and Kmmel, 1910-1912, revised 1950) showed the Magothy to consist of only one lithology (Cliffwood beds at Cliffwood Beach, Monmouth County). Subsequent pollen studies of the Magothy and the underlying Raritan Formation showed most of the Raritan to be the same age as the Magothy. Wolfe and Pakiser (1971) redefined and considerably expanded the Magothy.  Kmmel and Knapp (1904) had already recognized that the Magothy, as used here, contained a large number of lithologies. At the time of their study, the Magothy was extensively mined for clay and sand and was well exposed. Their subdivisions had economic designations (for example, Amboy stoneware clay). Barksdale and others (1943) later gave geographic names to these subdivisions, discussed individually below.  The lower contact of the Magothy in the Delaware River valley is difficult to place because the lower part of the Magothy is lithically similar to the underlying Potomac Formation. The contact is placed at the base of the lowest dark-gray clay in the Magothy. The best faunas from the Magothy were obtained from siderite concretions and slabs in and near Cliffwood Beach representing only the top of the formation.  These faunas were discussed in detail by Weller (1904, 1907) and supplemented by Sohl (in Owens and others, 1977). The presence of Ostrea cretacea in the Cliffwood Beach fauna suggests that the upper part of the Magothy is late Santonian in age. Wolfe and Pakiser (1971) and Christopher (1979, 1982) discussed the microfloral assemblage in the Magothy. Christopher subdivided the Magothy into three zones: Complexipollis exigua-Santalacites minor (oldest), Pseudoplicapollis longiannulata-Plicapollis incisa (middle), and Pseudoplicapollis cuneata-Semioculopollis verrucosa (youngest). The oldest zone, originally considered to be as old as Turonian, was subsequently considered to be post-Coniacian Christopher, 1982). The middle and upper zones are also probably Santonian. Christopher (1979) followed the nomenclature for the subdivisions elaborated upon earlier. The Cliffwood and Morgan beds, and, presumably the upper thin-bedded sequence, would include the youngest pollen zone; the Amboy Stoneware Clay Member and perhaps the uppermost part of the Old Bridge Sand Member, the middle pollen zone; and the lower part of the Old Bridge Sand Member and South Amboy Fire Clay Member, the oldest pollen zone. The Magothy is considered herein to be of Santonian age.  Cliffwood beds - Typically very sandy, horizontally bedded to crossbedded, mainly small-scale trough crossbeds. Thin layers of dark, fine, carbonaceous matter are interbedded with sand. Carbonaceous units are conspicuously micaceous; the sand is less so. Sand is typically fine to medium grained and locally burrowed. Burrows include the small-diameter Ophiomorpha nodosa and some that are not clay lined. Slabs of dark-reddish-brown siderite were common at the base of the bluff at Cliffwood Beach before the outcrop was covered. Some of these slabs had many fossil molds, typically a large number of pelecypods. Lower in the section, between high and low tide level, there is a pale-gray clay-silt about 1.5 m (5 ft) thick with many small reddish-brown siderite concretions. These concretions have many fossils that were described in detail by Weller (1904). The Cliffwood beds are about 7.5 m (25 ft) thick in outcrop. Equivalents of the Cliffwood beds are exposed near the Delaware River between Trenton and Florence, Burlington County. These beds are mainly sand, as are those at Cliffwood Beach, but they tend to have more crossbedding than the typical Cliffwood strata and no burrows or marine fossils. In addition, beds of quartz gravel are present in the Cliffwood near Riverside, Burlington County.  Morgan beds - Occur only in the northern part of the central sheet. They consist of interbedded, thin, dark-colored clay and fine-grained, light-colored, micaceous sand. Clay is locally more abundant in the Morgan than in the Cliffwood beds. Sand ranges from massive to locally crossbedded and locally has fine organic matter. This unit is exposed only in the South Amboy quadrangle where it is as much as 12 m (39 ft) thick. It grades downward into underlying clay.  Amboy Stoneware Clay Member - Crops out only in the South Amboy quadrangle in the central sheet and is mainly dark-gray, white-weathering, interbedded clay and silt to fine-grained quartz sand. Clay has abundant, fine, carbonaceous matter and fine mica flakes. Small cylindrical burrows are abundant in this unit. Locally, the clay is interbedded with sand and contains large pieces of lignitized, bored (Teredolites) logs. Large slabs of pyrite-cemented sand are associated with the woody beds. Amber occurs in some of the wood. Unit is approximately 7.5 m (25 ft) thick, but pinches out along strike. The Amboy Stoneware is disconformable on the underlying sand.  Old Bridge Sand Member - Predominantly a light-colored sand, extensively crossbedded and locally interbedded with dark-gray laminae; clay is highly carbonaceous, woody, in discontinuous beds, especially near the base. The scale of crossbedding varies from small to large. Locally, small burrows are present. Unit is as much as 12 m (39 ft) thick and rests disconformably on the underlying unit.  South Amboy Fire Clay Member - Basal member of the Magothy Formation. Unit resembles the Amboy Stoneware Clay Member, particularly in its lensing character. Unit is best exposed in the central sheet in the South Amboy quadrangle and in the Delaware River valley at the base of the bluffs at Florence. The South Amboy is a dark, massive to finely laminated clay, locally oxidized to white or red. Unit fills large channels and has local concentrations of large, pyrite-encrusted, lignitized logs. Some of the clay is slumped, suggesting post-depositional undercutting during channel migration. The clay is interbedded with fine- to medium-grained, crossbedded sand. The basal contact with the underlying Raritan is well exposed in the Sayre and Fisher Pit in Sayreville, Middlesex County, where the contact is marked by a deeply weathered gravel zone.","Original map source: Dalton, R.F., Herman, G.C., Monteverde, D.H., Pristas, R.S., Sugarman, P.J., and Volkert, R.A., 1999, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Bedrock Geology and Topographic Base Maps of New Jersey: New Jersey Geological Survey CD Series CD 00",{sedimentary}

Rests on rocks ranging from upper Ashlock Formation to Boyle Dolomite.  Base generally not exposed; apparently conformable where it overlies Boyle Dolomite, elsewhere unconformable. \nEconomic (limestone): A limestone quarry near the southwest corner of the Bryantsville quadrangle, described by Wolcott and Cressman (1971), has been extended into the northwestern part of the Stanford quadrangle.  The stone being quarried is from the middle and upper parts of the Lexington Limestone and is used for agricultural limestone, aggregate, and road metal; minor amounts are used for uncut building stone.  Abandoned quarries in the lower part of the Lexington Limestone, the Gilbert Member of the Ashlock Formation, the Rowland Member of the Drakes Formation, and the New Albany Shale have been worked for local supplies of aggregate, building stone, and road metal. \nHydrology: Palmquist and Hall (1960, 1961) have studied the groundwater resources in the area, and the following comments are largely based upon their work.  Very little water can be obtained from drilled wells in rocks of the Borden Formation, Boyle Dolomite and Brassfield Dolomite.  However, the Boyle Dolomite yields water from many springs, particularly along or near faults; one good spring, also near a fault, was noted in the Brassfield Dolomite.  Wells drilled into the Garrard Siltstone and Clays Ferry Formation may yield as much as 100 gallons per day.  All other formations may be expected to yield from 100 to 500 gallons per day, the higher production coming from wells drilled in the lowlands.  All the water is hard; water obtained from the New Albany Shale may contain iron and hydrogen sulfide.  Water from the Drakes Formation, Ashlock Formation, Calloway Creek Limestone, and Lexington Limestone may contain salt and hydrogen sulfide.  The best quality water is available from rocks of the High Bridge Group.

PA003): All three members of the Kinzers--the Emigsville, the York, and the Greenmount--are assigned to off-shelf environments. The basal Emigsville is a laterally persistent basinal facies with two components. The lower third is argillaceous dolomite and dolomitic limestone, overlain by shale. The York includes well-bedded lime mudstones, oolitic and bioclastic lime grainstones, and minor occurrences of periplatform breccia. [York was called Thomasville Member by Gohn (1976).] The Greenmount Member is a distinctive, impure carbonate (dark, pyritic, laminated to nodular limestone) with abundant fine-grained siliciclastic sediment which occurs as black shaly interbeds and dispersed silt-sized quartz and feldspar grains. Age of the Kinzers is Early Cambrian.  Kinzers Formation in the West York block of the Conestoga Valley, York Co., PA, is here subdivided into the basal Emigsville Member (Gohn, 1976), the York Member (new name), and the Greenmount Member (new name). Emigsville is the most laterally persistent. Thickness in the report area is approximately 100 to 200 ft. York Member is well exposed in Pit 1 at the Delta Carbonate Quarry. York previously informally designated Thomasville member by Gohn (1976). Thickness approximately 1000 to 1200 ft. Consists very pure to moderately pure carbonates. Greenmount Member described as sandstone and siltstone with very little carbonate where weathered. May be equivalent to Gohn's (1976) Longs Park member in Lancaster Co. Thickness varies from 50 ft to 180 ft. Authors state, ""The long history of use of the name Kinzers dictates the need for its continued use. The rocks included within the Kinzers Formation, however, vary dramatically from the type locality in Lancaster Co. to the York Valley portion of the Conestoga Valley. The unit thickens from about 200 ft to 1450 ft.  There may be some logic, therefore, in assigning group status to the name."" Underlies Ledger Formation.

On west side of park only parts of members 5, 4, and 3 are present and are mapped along with the disconformably underlying Prichard Formation as unit Yapp. On east side of park, the Appekunny disconformably overlies the Altyn Formation (see fig. 1); the contact between the two is placed on top of the uppermost dolomite bed of the Allyn and locally shows as much as 2 m of erosional relief. Thickness on east side of park ranges from 530 to 690 m. Member thicknesses are from measured section near Apikuni Mountain. Member 5 consists of bright-green argillite and lesser amounts of siltite. Lamination is wavy, nonparallel, lining-upward couplets. Mud-chip breccias, fluid-escape structures, and dolomite-filled subaqueous shrinkage cracks common. About 60 m thick. Member 4 contrasts sharply with member 5 and is poorly exposed because outcrops are mostly cleaved and easily weathered. Member consists of thin to very thin laminae of olive siltite and thin lenticular beds of rusty-brown arenite. Commonly stained by iron and manganese oxides. Notably cleaved, folded, and faulted near thrust faults. Lower contact placed at base of lowermost sequence of thinly laminated siltite. About 135 m thick. Member 3 is characterized by interlaminated and interbedded grayish-green siltite, yellowish-brown arenite, and lesser amounts of grayish-green argillite; subaqueous shrinkage cracks, load structures, and mud-chip breccia common. Lamination is wavy nonparallel; arenite beds typically contain pyrite. Lower contact placed at base of lowermost bed of pyritic arenite, where pyritic arenite and overlying beds are wavy laminated and contain numerous shallow-water sedimentary structures. About 165 m thick. Member 2 consists mostly of interlaminated siltite and some argillite. Thin arenite beds, 2.5-7.5 cm thick, common in lower part. Bed lamination is even parallel to nonparallel and curved nonparallel; some beds show broad, low-angle hummocky cross-lamination and small-scale, scour-and-fill structures. Lower contact is placed on top of uppermost maroon sequence of member 1 and generally coincides with an increase in thickness of siltite laminae in member 2. In areas where maroon beds are absent, contact between members 1 and 2 may be indistinguishable. About 165 m thick. Member 1 closely resembles member 2 except for the presence of maroon beds and consists of alternating successions of pale-maroon and grayish-green siltite and minor argillite. Laminae are generally thinner in member 1 than in member 2. A quartz arenite interval forms a key marker about 55 m above base of member 1. This interval thins gradually northward from about 25 m at Elk Mountain (at south end of park) to 15 m at Bear Mountain (near U.S.-Canada boundary). About 135 m thick",,{sedimentary}

The gabbro does not have a foliation and postdates the metamorphic fabric in the host rocks.

The Sidney and Nosben coal beds are probably equivalent, respectively, to the Upper Elkhorn Nos. 2 and 3 of Hunt and others(1937).

Thin clay partings are present locally, and the high-ash zone at the top of the seam is commonly separated from the coal below by a clay parting ranging from a featheredge to as much as 3 inches.

29752,21,Plutons of the Yukon-Tanana Upland,,Early Jurassic,"Sub-equigranular, medium- to coarse-grained, weakly- to nonfoliated hornblende quartz monzonite and lesser monzonite and quartz monzodiorite, herein called the Napoleon Creek pluton. Typical primary modal mineralogy is 38 percent quartz, 4050 percent plagioclase, 2040 percent K-feldspar, 1520 percent hornblende, 1 percent sphene, 1 percent opaques, 01 percent myrmekite, and trace apatite and allanite. Generally characterized by large K-feldspar and obvious hornblende phenocrysts, which define the foliation, if present. Quartz is invariably strained, and crystal margins are commonly granulated. Most contacts with country rocks are linear zones lacking outcrops and displaying no obvious hornfels aureole, suggesting post-intrusive faulting. Magnetic susceptibility is typically high (.001.027 SI), but the core of the body is significantly less magnetic (0.000310.00061 SI). Includes small bodies of biotite clinopyroxenite and coarse-grained hornblende gabbro, which may be inclusions, dikes, and (or) marginal phases. Both the Napoleon Creek pluton and the mafic phases are cut by minor late granite aplitepegmatite dikes. Extensive, sheared zones of gold-bearing quartzcarbonatesericitechloritepyrite alteration are present within the pluton, yield an early Cretaceous Ar/ Ar isochron age (sample 4; table 1), and are under current industry investigation. Plutonic hornblende yielded a Ar/ Ar plateau age of 186 Ma (sample 7; table 1)",,{igneous}

Previously mapped as part of the Taylor Mountain batholith (Foster, 1976), but displays significant contrasts in mineralogy, texture, major oxide composition, and age. Typical primary modal mineralogy is 2025 percent quartz, 3040 percent plagioclase, 2030 percent K-feldspar, 05 percent hornblende, 510 percent biotite, 12 percent myrmekite, <1 percent sphene, magmatic? epidote and opaques, and trace apatite and allanite. K-feldspar megacrysts are common; aplite dikes are locally abundant, especially in upper Stonehouse Creek. Quartz is commonly strained and mortar texture is prevalent. Usually exhibits little alteration, but where alteration is present, it consists mostly of hornblende replaced by epidote + chlorite.  Magnetic susceptibility is usually high, typically .004.012 SI. Contacts with surrounding rocks are mostly obscure. Lack of obvious hornfels or skarn in surrounding calcareous metamorphic rocks suggests contacts are largely faulted. No significant mineralization is known to occur in this pluton, although quartzpyrite and K feldsparquartz veins occur at the head of Chicken Creek and gold prospects are present near the Chicken pluton at Purdy and Lilliwig Creek. Hornblende from the Chicken pluton yields a Ar/ Ar plateau age of 187.8 Ma (sample 8; table 1), and a Ar/ Ar isochron age of 54 Ma for the biotite indicates significant heating in early Tertiary time, presumably associated with nearby gabbro. The presence of apparently magmatic epidote in this pluton suggests it crystallized at elevated pressure, probably >5 kbar",,{igneous}

Inconclusive field evidence suggests that some of the coal beds occur in small channels.  Only the Main Nolin coal bed has been mined and it is the most important coal.

Sandstone weathers dark gray to medium gray where locally asphaltic. Conglomerate consists of beds, stringers, and lenses of well-rounded granules and pebbles of clear to milky quartz, commonly frosted and iron-stained, in a matrix of fine to very coarse quartz sand; pebbles are as much as 1 1/2 to 2 inches across, predominantly  1/4 to 1/2 inch in major diameter; grades into sandstone. Shale, medium light-gray, weathers yellowish orange, light gray, and reddish gray, commonly sandy; plates of selenite and small nodules of pyrite in exposure at Nolin Darn. Coal, thin and of only local occurrence about 20 to 30 feet below Main Nolin coal bed. \nEconomic (coal): Coal outcrops, prospects, and abandoned mines shown on the map indicate the wide areal distribution of coal beds in the Tradewater and Caseyville Formations.  There are at least five coal beds for which accurate correlations throughout the quadrangle could not be determined.  Very likely most of these coals are thin and of only local occurrence.  Inconclusive field evidence suggests that some of the coal beds occur in small channels.  Only the Main Nolin coal bed has been mined and it is the most important coal.  It varies from 12 inches to 36 inches in thickness where exposed. Reported thicknesses of 48 inches at abandoned mines could not be verified.  According to Mullins and others (1963, p. 15), estimated reserves of the Main Nolin coal in the quadrangle total 18,269 short tons.  No coal mines were in operation during the geologic mapping. \nEconomic (minerals): The ""iron ores"" of the quadrangle are not economically important but are of interest historically. They occur in the Leitchfield, Tradewater, and Caseyville Formations.  Limonite, siderite, and ferruginous sandstones were used to make cold blast iron in the Nolin charcoal furnace (known locally as the Baker Furnace) near the mouth of Davis Creek.  According to local residents, most of the ""ore"" was obtained from deposits in the Bee Spring quadrangle.  The furnace, built about 1846, was not operated after 1850 (written communication, C. E. Whittle, 1962).  The furnace is below seasonal pool level of Nolin Reservoir, and is partly exposed during periods of drawdown.",Ptc; Nolin Reservoir Quadrangle (GQ-895) | http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsweb/PubsSearching/MoreInfo.asp?titleInput=896 | Map description and column: http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsmap/kgsgeoserver/geolDescID.asp?idType=pointID&fmcode=324TRCV&gq_num=895&map_level=24K,{sedimentary}

Contact with underlying Kinkaid Limestone is sharp and unconformable. \nEconomic (petroleum): Exploration for oil in the region started about 1938 when a test hole encountered oil near Silver City.  Extensive exploration began in 1949 with the drilling of numerous test holes in the Huntsville and Lewisburg areas to the southwest (Nuttall, 1964, p. 10).  Between 1949 and 1956 most oil and gas fields of the quadrangle were discovered (see oil and gas map).  Only the northern parts of the Big Branch gas pool and of the Mt. Zion North and Silver City South oil pools lie within the quadrangle (Schwalb, unpublished ms., Kentucky Geol. Survey).  Oil and gas have been encountered in four stratigraphic zones: (1) sandstone of the Pennsylvanian Tradewater and Caseyville Formations; (2) Upper Mississippian Tar Springs Sandstone (""Jett sand"" of drillers); (3) Upper Mississippian Hardinsburg Sandstone (""Jones sand"" of drillers); and (4) Upper Mississippian Big Clifty Sandstone Member of the Golconda Formation (""Jackson sand"" of drillers).  The top of the Big Clifty lies 320 to 340 feet below top of the Menard Limestone.^p^pThe Mt. Zion North oil pool was discovered in 1954 and produced oil from the Tar Springs and Hardinsburg Sandstones.  The central part of the pool lies on the westward-dipping flank of a dome and the northern part lies within a series of fault blocks.  Most wells initially produced about 2 to 10 barrels of oil per day, but when the wells were water flooded and sand fractured, production increased to about 100 barrels per day with a tapering off to about 30 barrels per day after about 3 months (Nuttall, 1964, p. 13-15).  Most wells are now abandoned.^p^pThe Silver City oil pool, formerly called the South Hill oil pool, has produced oil since 1938 from the Hardinsburg Sandstone. Most production is from wells along the crestal zone of a westward-plunging anticline.  The Silver City South oil pool was developed about 1956 in the Hardinsburg Sandstone; most wells are now abandoned.^p^pMinor oil and gas pools within the quadrangle include the northern part of the Big Branch gas pool, the Beech Grove School oil pool, and the Hanks oil pool.  The Big Branch gas pool has produced minor amounts of gas from sandstones of Pennsylvanian age at a depth of about 500 feet and from the Hardinsburg Sandstone at a depth of about 900 feet.  Oil was discovered in the Beech Grove School oil pool in 1944 at a depth of about 100 feet in the Tar Springs Sandstone and at a depth of about 310 feet in the Big Clifty Sandstone Member of the Golconda Formation.  Production of oil tapered off rapidly and the pool was abandoned in 1945.  The Hanks oil pool has produced oil from Pennsylvanian sandstone at an average depth of about 500 feet, and from the Tar Springs Sandstone at an average depth of about 900 feet. \nTRADEWATER AND CASEYVILLE FORMATIONS USGS Unit Info: not available   Sandstone, light-gray, weathers light reddish gray; fine to medium grained, micaceous, medium to very thick bedded and in part crossbedded; local light- to medium-gray siltstone partings. \nShale, medium-to dark-gray; locally interbedded with dark gray siltstone. \nLimestone, medium-gray, very coarse to very fine grained, thin- to thick-bedded.

Exposed along streams, in recesses commonly developed beneath overlying unit. \nGeotechnical: Clay of the lacustrine deposits, Waldron Shale, and New Providence Shale Member of the Borden Formation is plastic when wet.  Roads and other structures built on these units should be provided with adequate drainage and cuts should not be oversteepened.  Clay of these units and clay residue from weathered limestone are relatively impermeable; percolation rates may be too slow for adequate drainage of septic tanks.  Permeability of the lacustrine and outwash deposits and of limestone residue varies considerably depending on clay content.  Lacustrine deposits in the southern part of the quadrangle and loess in the northern part have good to poor compaction and moderate to high susceptibility to frost action; the shrink-swell potential is high in lacustrine deposits, moderate in loess; the water table in the lacustrine deposits reaches the surface during wet periods (Zimmerman, 1966, p. 8687,90-91). \nLand-Use: High water during the 1937 flood reached 461 feet in the northwestern part of the quadrangle (Grover, 1938, p. 616).",Sw; Louisville East Quadrangle (GQ-1203) | http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsweb/PubsSearching/MoreInfo.asp?titleInput=326 | Map description and column: http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsmap/kgsgeoserver/geolDescID.asp?idType=pointID&fmcode=355WLDR&gq_num=1203&map_level=24K,{sedimentary}
