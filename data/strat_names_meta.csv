28985,Echo Bay,Early Proterozoic,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: The Echo Bay Formation consists of a thick pile of andesite flows and breccias, sparse rhyodacite flows and breccias, intercalated epiclastic rocks and minor beds of reworked tuff.  The formation is divided into 3 informal members - Mile Lake, Suprise Lake, and Sparkplug Lake members. The stratigraphically lowest member (Mile Lake) comprises 400 m of intercalated epiclastic rocks and lava flows while the overlying Suprise Lake member contains only minor beds of epiclastic rocks between lava flows. Andesite flows and breccias with abundant plagioclase phenocrysts that overlie Mackenzie Tuff are collectively termed the Sparkplug Lake member. This member includes a small, composite andesite cone and vent complex approximately 1 km in diameter located south of Lindsley Bay but stratigraphically higher in the section than most rocks of the Sparkplug Lake member. In general, lavas of the Sparkplug Lake member are distinguished from those of the Surprise Lake member only by their stratigraphic positon. The lava flows of the Echo Bay Formation are plagioclase porphyritic and the abundance of phenocrysts may range within individual flows from 5 to 40 per cent. Many of the flows show trachytic texture defined by platy plagioclase crystals up to 1 cm across. Before alteration, most flows contained small pyroxene or hornblende phenocrysts, commonly rimmed with opaque Fe-oxides. Relict olivine euhedra occur in some of the lower flows. All Echo Bay Formation lavas are altered to some degree: ferromagnesian minerals are often replaced by chlorite, opaque Fe-Ti oxides, epidote, and clay minerals. The matrix is commonly a fine grained mosaic of sphene, albite, quartz, chlorites, zeolites, and clay minerals. Amygdules, commonly sparse but locally up to 20 per cent of the rock, are predominantly silica but in some flows located within alteration haloes around granitoid intrusions, contain mixtures of quartz, epidote, chlorites, pyrite and calcite. In outcrops flows are generally massive or columnar jointed but some have platy-jointed or brecciated bases. Brecciated bases grade upward into massive lava, and are often partially oxidized to a brick-red colour. Many individual flows have reddened flow breccias at their tops and margins. Epiclastic rocks of the Mile Lake member consist almost entirely of volcanic detritus and are coarse arkosic to lithic sandstone and clast-supported conglomerate, occasionally polymictic but normally dominated by clasts of subrounded to rounded andesite. Some massive conglomerate beds, up to several metres thick, are probably laharic as they contain blocks of a wide variety of size, shape, and rock type floating in a muddy or silty matrix. Many of the sandstones display normal grading and comprise imbricated blocky plagioclase crystals with rounded corners and semipherical augite grains. These beds are probably reworked crystal tuff. Ripple lamination and crossbedding are commonly preserved in the sandstones but exposures are insufficient for paleocurrent analysis (Hildebrand, 1981). The Echo Bay Formation also includes an intrusive member (Cobalt Porphyry member) (Hildebrand, 1982).  Distribution: It is best exposed in a section from Dowdell Point to Echo Bay, where it is nearly 3000 m thick (Hildebrand, 1981).  Locality Data: Thickness(m): Maximum 3000.  Relationship: The Echo Bay Formation is a unit of the LaBine Group. It conformably overlies the Port Radium Formation. Eruption centres for the lavas are not exposed and lay outside the map area. Flows that intertongue with sediments of the Cameron Bay Formation become thinner and sparser eastward, suggesting that one centre lay west of the map area. Similarly, flows that pinch out to the south and west, interfinger with conglomerate in the Vance Peninsula region, were presumably erupted from centres to the east or north of the map area. The Cameron Bay Formation overlies the Echo Bay Formation, except in the southern part of the area, where both formations interfinger (Hildebrand, 1981). The Cameron Bay Formation is separated from the underlying Echo Bay Formation by local unconformities formed during synvolcanic erosion (Reardon, 1992).",Northwest Territories,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/017000/GSCC00053017354.html,21
29019,Kitchener,Middle Proterozoic,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: The Kitchener Formation consists of calcareous and dolomitic siltite and argillite, silly dolomite and limestone, argillite, siltite, sandy dolomite and minor quartzite. In eastern and central exposures a lower unit comprising interlaminated green argillite and siltite, and green or grey dolomitic or calcareous argillite, with minor quartzite and sandy dolomite is recognized. Ripple cross-lamination, ripple marked surfaces, pyrite and mud cracks are locally abundant. The bulk of the formation consists of thin to thick-bedded, dark grey dolomitic and nondolomitic siltite, black argillite, and minor sandy dolomite, intraformational conglomerate, oolitic limestone and quartzite. Molar tooth structures in carbonate beds and mud cracks, ripple marks and load casts in clastic beds are locally abundant. Stromatolites occur in southeastern and central exposures. Siltite and argillite content increases to the west and north. In the Hughes Range rocks similar to the lower unit also occur at the top of the formation. A thick 17 to 25 m (56 to 82 ft) stromatolite zone occurs near the top of the formation in the Steeples and Moyie Lake Mount Baker areas.  Distribution: Exposed in the western Hughes and Lizard Ranges and southern Purcell Mountains. Thickness varies from 500 to 900 m (1,640 to 2,952 ft) in the Hughes Range to 1,500 m (4,920 ft) near Moyie Lake.  Type Locality: Upper Moyie Lake, near Jerome, southeastern British Columbia (Schofield, 1915).  Locality Data: Thickness(m): Minimum 500, Maximum 1500.  Relationship: The Kitchener conformably overlies the Creston Formation and is conformably overlain by the Van Creek Formation ('Siyeh Formation' of Rice, 1937 and Schofield, 1914a, 1915). In the Nelson east half and Lardeau east half map-areas the Kitchener and Van Creek cannot be mapped separately. The Kitchener is correlative with the Werner Peak (Empire) and 'Siyeh' formations of Montana, and the lower and middle members of the Helena Formation of the Galton to Clark Ranges.  History: Daly (1905) defined the Kitchener Formation as overlying the Creston and underlying the Moyie (discontinued; 'Siyeh' equivalent) formations. Schofield recognized that Daly's Kitchener Formation near Kingsgate, British Columbia underlay the Creston and proposed the name Aldridge Formation for these rocks. In other areas Daly's Kitchener strata conformably overlay the Creston and the name Kitchener was retained for these strata (Schofield, 1914a). Rice (1937, p. 9-11) was unable to recognize Schofield's Kitchener-'Siyeh' boundary. He included the lower argillaceous and middle carbonate units of Schofield's 'Siyeh' in the Kitchener Formation.

Striated clasts common in tillite, rare in glaciomarine diamictite. Cobble and boulder composition is mainly dolomite, limestone, greenstone, quartzite, and a small amount of shield-derived crystalline rocks. Matrix of diamictite is lithic arenite or greywacke, and reflects composition of cobbles and boulders at the same stratigraphic level.  Distribution: Thickness ranges between a few tens to 500 m (1,640 ft), and is 235 m (771 ft) at the type section. Extends from central Mackenzie Mountains northwesterly for 500 km (310 mi).  Type Locality: Ridge about 13 km (8 mi) west of Hayhook Lake in the Plateau thrust plate (63 deg 33'30'N, 127 deg 03'W).  Relationship: Grades downward into Sayunei Fm and is also unconformable on older units. The base of the Shezal is placed at the first occurrence of numerous subrounded to well-rounded clasts of dolomite, limestone, quartzite, greenstone or crystalline rocks embedded in a matrix of unevenly bedded to scaly siltstone and greywacke. The top is placed at the sharp contact of diamictites of the Shezal, with dark grey to black pyritic shale or thinly laminated lime-stone of the conformably overlying Twitya Fm. The Shezal corresponds to the Bonnet Plume Tillite of Ziegler (1959), the middle unit of the Rapitan Gp by Gabrielse et al. (1973) and Upitis (1966) and the 'Diamictite' of Eisbacher (1976).",Northwest Territories,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/013000/GSCC00053013681.html,21
29068,Twitya,Hadrynian,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: Near the base, dark pyritic shale or thinly laminated to bedded grey limestone. Shale, siltstone and internally parallel laminated sandstone. Numerous slump folds in the basal parts of the formation. Sandstones are quartzo-feldspathic arenites. Channels of quartz-chert pebble conglomerate. Towards the west (Snake River region) turbiditic sandstones and platform carbonate.  Distribution: Extends from central Mackenzie Mountains for 500 km (311 mi) northwestward, and ranges in thickness from 100-700 m (328-2,297 ft) in exposed sections and probably more in subsurface sections. It is 672 m (2,204 ft) thick at the type section.  Type Locality: Ridge about 15 km (9 mi) west of Hayhook Lake in the Plateau thrust plate (63°33'30'N, 127°03'30'W).  Locality Data: Thickness(m): Minimum 100, Maximum 700, Typical 672.  Relationship: Rests in sharp but generally conformable contact on Shezal Formation with the base placed at the sharp contact between diamictite of the Shezal Fm and dark grey to black pyritic shale of the former. The angular unconformity postulated by Blusson (1971) to be between the Shezal and the Twitya formations was not substantiated by later work. The Twitya is gradation-ally overlain by the Keele Formation with the contact placed at the base of the first carbonate unit. The Twitya Formation corresponds to the upper unit of the Rapitan Formation of Upitis (1966) and Gabrielse et al. (1973), and the 'shale' unit of the Rapitan Group of Eisbacher (1976). Yeo et al. (1978) and Yeo (1981) place the Twitya Formation in the Hay Creek Group.

29120,Blueflower,Ediacaran,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: The Blueflower Formation is a recessive weathering unit consisting mainly of fissile shale and lesser, non-fissile mudstone that are dark grey to black, partly silty, partly pyritic, and partly calcareous.  The mudrocks weather grey to black and brown.  The dominant, dark grey shale and mudstone are interrupted by sandstone beds that are mainly thin and fine or very fine grained, with some units of medium and thick, coarse grained beds.  Many of the sandstone beds have turbidite characteristics.  Near the base are several units of ribbon-bedded limestone (Aitken, 1989b).  Distribution: Central  Mackenzie Mountains.  The formation is 450 m thick at the type secion in the Sekwi Brook area (Aitken, 1989b).  Type Locality: The type section of the Blueflower Formation is at latitude 63° 25' 25'' N and longitude 128° 25' 00'' W (Aitken, 1989b).  Relationship: The Blueflower Formation overlies the Gametrail Formation of the Windermere Supergroup with apparent conformity, and is conformably and gradationally overlain by the Risky Formation.  Because of its position below redbeds near the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary, its turbiditic character, and a small content of quartz granules in some beds, the Blueflower is very probably a correlative of part of the 'Grit unit' of Selwyn Basin (Gabrielse et al., 1973).  It appears to be a distal facies of the 'Grit unit' (Aitken, 1989b, 1991).  History: The formation is named after Blueflower Mountain, a prominent peak in the area, elevation 7541 feet, latitude 63 ° 20' 04'' N; longitude 128° 19' 16'' W, overlooking Natla River to the south (Aitken, 1989b).",Northwest Territories,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/001000/GSCC00053001558.html,21

Distribution: 4.5 m; found only on Bache Peninsula.  Type Locality: Canyon near abandoned R.C.M. Police post, Bache Peninsula, Ellesmere Island;  Relationship: Apparent conformity at base and top with adjacent units, but Troelsen (1950) considered the contacts to be disconformities from the abrupt lithological changes and Cowie (1961) considered, from the horizontal variation in lithology and ages (between Bache Peninsula and Inglefield Land, Greenland), that a hiatus existed in which there was erosion and/or nondeposition of beds. The Police Post beds are presumably equivalent to beds of the Lower Cambrian, basinal, Scoresby Bay Formation (Kerr, 1967b).  History: Lower Cambrian trilobites were collected near the Police Post by Bentham (1936); Wordie and Drever (Wordie, 1938) later found the fossil-yielding beds and examined the stratigraphic relationships. Poulsen (1946), who described the fossils collected by Bentham, referred to the beds as the 'Bonniopsis horizon'.",Nunavut,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/012000/GSCC00053012010.html,21
29298,Goose Cove,Early Cambrian - Early Ordovician,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: Green metamorphosed tuff, agglomerate, and mafic pillow lava with thin units of greywacke, black pyritic slate, and limestone. The fine-grained schist appears to be derived from a well-stratified rock, as finely laminated light to dark schist is dominant. The rocks vary from a semischist to an intensely foliated schist, depending on the intensity of deformation. The rocks at Goose Cove South have a tuffaceous origin. North of Goose Cove the greenschist contains coarse tuffs and agglomerate in a greyish-green matrix. There are also poorly preserved pillows in the roadcuts in this area. At Goose Cove and Starks Bight the greenschist has pelitic units, bands of limestone, and greywacke beds up to 10 m thick. The principal minerals in the rocks of the Goose Cove Formation include chlorite, albite, epidote, muscovite, tremolite, and actinolite.  Distribution: The structural thickness at the type locality is about 180 m, but the stratigraphic thickness is unknown. The formation is found at Lock's Cove, Goose Cove, Starks Bight, Milan Arm (all of NTS 2 M/5), Fishot Islands, Pigeon Island, and Great Verdon Island (all of NTS 2 M/4) Great Northern Peninsula.  Type Locality: Goose Cove, northern Great Northern Peninsula, northeastern Newfoundland (NTS 2 M/5).  Relationship: The Goose Cove Formation gradationally overlies the Lower Cambrian to Lower Ordovician Ireland Point Volcanics. It is gradationally overlain by the Lower Cambrian to Lower Ordovician Green Ridge Amphibolite with an increase in grain size of prismatic amphibole crystals and decrease in the amount of chlorite, upsection. This upper contact is exposed east of Goose Cove road (NTS 2 M/5) and along the south side of Easter Tickle (NTS 2 M/4). The St. Anthony Group is divided into the White Hills Peridotite, Ireland Point Volcanics, Goose Cove Formation, and the Green Ridge Amphibolite.  History: Cooper (1937) named the formation the Goose Cove Schist, which is found concentrically surrounding the White Hills Peridotite and on the Fishot Islands. Tuke (1968) and Smyth (1971) included all of the rocks underlying the White Hills Peridotite and on Fishot Islands, in the Goose Cove Formation. Williams and Smyth (1983) interpreted the formation to more closely follow the boundaries of Cooper (1937).",Newfoundland & Labrador,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/005000/GSCC00053005717.html,21
29299,Halifax,Early Ordovician,formal; currently in use,"Age Justification: Graptolites, found between 2,400 m and 850 m below the top of the group, indicate an Early Ordovician age (Smitheringale, 1960; Crosby, 1962). The upper part of the underlying Goldenville Group is probably also Early Ordovician, so that most of the Halifax Group is probably Early Ordovician. The top of the Halifax may be younger since the overlying New Canaan Formation in the Kentville (NTS 21 H/1) area contains Silurian fossils. A brachiopod of Caradoc age was found in the Halifax Group at Cape St. Mary (NTS 21 B/1). 

Type Locality: Halifax, Halifax County, Nova Scotia (NTS 11 D/12). No type section was designated by Ami (1900d) or Woodman (1904a, 1904b). Bell (1929) regarded the thick section at Black River (NTS 21 H/1, 21 A/16) as the most complete section of the group in the province. Crosby (1962) reported that part of this section is now obscured, and suggested that the Halifax Group should extend below the base designated by Faribault (1909). The complete section has never been thoroughly described.

Distribution: Thickness varies from about 3600 m in the type area to about 500 m in southwest Nova Scotia (Taylor, 1967a). Faribault (1909) measured a continuous section of 3565 m at Black River, Kings County (NTS 21 H/1, A/16). The formation is exposed widely in southern mainland Nova Scotia as numerous outliers in the cores of northeast- or east-trending synclines. The underlying Ordovician or (?)older Goldenville Group is exposed in the intervening anticlines, except in a region of plunge depression centred in Lunenburg County, where a broad belt of the Halifax Group is present.

Locality Data: Thickness(m): Minimum 500, Maximum 3600.

Lithology: Greyish-green to black and, locally, red slate, siltstone, and minor sandstone, generally thinly bedded and strongly sheared. The slates locally contain abundant pyrite and arsenopyrite. The group is regionally metamorphosed to greenschist and, in places, amphibolite facies, and is locally schistose. Hornfels is developed close to granitic plutons. The Halifax Group is subdivided into five formations, from base to top: Mosher's Island Formation, a thin, metalliferous grey slate; the Cunard Formation, a very thick, pyritiferous, graphitic, fissile slate laced with thin, fine-grained silstones and sandstones; the Feltzen Formation, banded grey slate intercalated with black, graptolitic slate and thin siltstones; the Delanceys Formation, a grey, laminated silty slate with abundant fine-scaled lenses of quartz siltstone; and the Rockville Notch Formation, a dark grey to black pelitic laminite with siltstone microlenses.

Fossils: graptolites, brachiopods

Relationship: The Halifax Group conformably overlies the Goldenville Group, and together comprise the Meguma Supergroup (Schenk, 1995). The contact with the overlying Ordovician to Silurian White Rock Formation is locally unconformable, but regionally conformable (Harris and Schenk, 1975). The Halifax Group is intruded by Upper Paleozoic granitic plutons and unconformably overlain by the Lower Carboniferous Horton and Windsor groups and the Upper Triassic Wolfville Formation of the Fundy Group. The Halifax Group in the western half of the Meguma Zone has been subdivided into five conformable formations, several of which can be traced into the eastern half of the Zone.

It is interbedded with limey siltstone, grey to brown sandstone, white to grey limestone, Iimestone breccia, dark grey and green chert, and siliceous argillite, The shale beds form a smeared and streaky matrix around boudins. The formation is considered to be a mélange.  Distribution: The thickness was estimated to be 152 m by Cooper (1937) and 65 m by Tuke (1968). The base and top of the formation are not exposed in the Hare Bay area and the internal structure is chaotic, making accurate thickness measurements impossible.  Type Locality: Northwest Arm, Hare Bay, northern Great Northern Peninsula, northeastern Newfoundland (NTS 12 P/8).  Relationship: The Northwest Ann Formation structurally overlies the Middle Ordovician Goose Tickle Formation and is overlain by the Proterozoic III to Lower Cambrian Maiden Point Formation. The formation has therefore been transported. The chaotic nature of the Northwest Arm Formation indicates emplacement in a semiconsolidated condition and transport by gravity sliding. Locally, it contains sandstone blocks that resemble the sandstone in the underlying Goose Tickle Formation (Williams and Smyth, 1983). The upper contact is abrupt and is exposed on the west side of Triangle Point in Pistolet Bay (NTS 2 M/12) and at several localities along the north shore of Northwest Arm in Hare Bay. In the Hare Bay area (NTS 2 M/4,5) the Northwest Arm is the correlative of lithologically contrasting sequences such as the Lower Ordovician St. George Group and Cape Onion formation. South of the Hare Bay areas, the Northwest Arm Formation is correlative with the transorted Green Point Formation at Green Point (NTS 12 G/1) and Port au Port Peninsula (NTS 12 B/10, 11) and the Middle Arm Point Formation of the Humber Arm Supergroup at Humber Arm (NTS 12 G/1).  History: Cooper (1937), who named the formation, believed that the rocks were autochthonous, above the Table Head Formation and below the Goose Tickle Formation, both of Middle Ordovician age. Tuke (1968) discovered the Early Ordovician graptolite Staurograptus dichotomus. The formation was extended to the Hare Bay and Pistolet Bay areas (Gillis, 1966; Tuke, 1968; Williams et al., 1973; Williams and Smyth, 1974).",Newfoundland and Labrador,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/011000/GSCC00053011030.html,21

It is exposed on the northwestern side of Bell Island (NTS 1 N/10) where the beds dip 8 deg northwestward under Conception Bay (NTS 1 N/11). Submarine exploration suggests that the Lower Ordovician succession of the Wabana Group occupies a fault bounded, north-northeast trending block with the depocentre 3 km north of Bell Island. Its maximum extent within Conception Bay is shown in Miller (1983, Figure 6).

The magnetic properties of the oolitic hematite are discussed in Ozdemir and Deutsch (1984).

Relationship: The base of the Wabana Group is sharp and disconformably overlies the Dominion Formation of the Bell Island Group. The top is not exposed as the group extends under Conception Bay, and its submarine extension beyond the bay is unknown. Regional correlations in the North Atlantic are discussed by Rast et al. (1976), O'Brien et al. (1983), and King and O'Brien (1989).

History: van Ingen (1914) introduced the term Wabana Series for the upper part of the Lower Ordovician section and divided some of it into formations, in ascending order, Pyrite bed, Scotia ore bed, upper ore bed, and Gravel Head. The term Scotia ore bed was used in the original (circa 1893) landclaim of the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Company (Hayes, 1915, pp. 4-5). Rose (1952) replaced ""series"" by ""group"" . Nautiyal (1966) informally relegated the Wabana Group to forma-tional status. Ranger (1979) retained the name Wabana Group and subdivided it into several formations, which coincide in part with van Ingen's (1914) subdivisions. King (1982) and Pickerill and Fillion (1983) informally adapted much of Ranger's (1979) terminology. Ranger et al.

History: The Table Head Group, as defined by Nelson (1955) and Woodard (1957), includes Rich-ardson's divisions L to N (Logan et al., 1863). Rocks of the Black Cove Formation were included in the upper Table Head Series by Schuchert and Dunbar (1934) and the upper Table Head Formation by Whittington and Kindle (1963). Klappa et al.

The basal 50 m (164 ft) in the type section are argillaceous, finely silty and include some very dark grey shale (interfingering Road River Fm shales). Pale grey and pale buff colouring and microsucrosic texture are characteristic features which distinguish it from the underlying brown less finely sucrosic dolomites of the Mount Kindle Fm and from the overlying aphanitic limestone and micropyritic shale of the Tatsieta Fm or, where the latter is absent to the east, from the overlying brown sucrosic dolomite of the Arnica Fm. There is some limestone in the upper part (100 m) of some of the thicker sections indicating that an upper dolomite-limestone member may have been more widely distributed than at present.

The limestone is buff, aphanitic with some white and chalky. Pale grey silty dolomite in the upper part occurs northeastward from the Peel River. In the Tree River area, the Tatsieta can be subdivided into three subunits as follows: a basal subunit of buff aphanitic limestone and some pale green and pale green-brown shale; a middle subunit of buff calcareous dolomite grading upward to microcrystal-line dolomitic limestone; an uppermost subunit of buff dolomitic limestone and pale green, micro-pyritic shale.  Distribution: It is 61 m (200 ft) in the type well and attains a maximum thickness of 165 m (541 ft) in the west. It occurs throughout much of the Peel River map-area.  Type Locality: In borehole R.O.C. Grandview Hills No. 1 (A37; 67 deg 06'21'N, 130 deg 52'30'W) across the Mackenzie River from Tatsieta Lake between 1,055 and 994 m (3,462 and 3,262 ft).  Locality Data: Thickness(m): Maximum 165, Typical 61.  Interval(m): From 1055, To 944.  Relationship: It unconformably overlies the Peel Fm. It is overlain with sharp contact by the Arnica Formation (formerly the Dolomite member of the Gossage Fm). In the Richardson Mountains it is transitional to part of the Road River Fm; to the southwest, it may be equivalent to Michelle Formation; to the east it may be equivalent to the basal part of Fort Norman Fm. Morrow pers. comm. 1980) considers that the Tatsieta Fm may be equivalent to the Camsell and Delorme Formations to the south but that nothing definite can be stated because the Delorme-Camsell relationship is not understood.

29651,Duvernay,Frasnian,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: Interbedded dark brown bituminous shales, dark brown, black and occasionally grey-green calcareous shales and dense argillaceous limestones. Sediments are characteristically petroliferous and exhibit plane parallel millimetre lamination. Rarely is composed of thin calcarenitic beds and coral rich lime mud accumulations. Disseminated pyrite common within some thin stringers.  Distribution: Distributed over most of central Alberta and absent in areas of Leduc reef growth, except beneath the Duhamel reef, where it may be represented by a thin development of calcilutite. At its type section in the East Shale Basin it is 53 m (174 ft) thick; it thickens to 75 m (246 ft) east and southeastward towards the Southern Alberta Shelf. Northeastward it reaches 120 m (394 ft) at its truncation in the subsurface at the pre-Cretaceous unconformity. In the West Shale Basin it averages 60 m (197 ft) thick and thickens northward, attaining over 250 m (820 ft) to the east of Lesser Slave Lake.  Type Locality: Type well Anglo Canadian Beaverhill Lake No. 2 in 11-11-50-17W4M, in Alberta, between 1,178 and 1,231 m (3,863 and 4,038 ft); continuous wireline core.  Relationship: Conformably overlies platform carbonates of the Cooking Lake Formation and is the basinal equivalent of surrounding Leduc reef growth peripheral to the East Shale Basin. Thickens, up a depositional slope towards Leduc buildups, passing into lithologies more typical of the lower Ireton Formation which conformably overlie it elsewhere. The top of the Duvernay may therefore be considered partially facies controlled. Northward thick developments previously assigned to this formation may include basinal equivalents of the Cooking Lake, Leduc and Ireton formations and are conformably overlain by the Grosmont Formation. Further westward in the West Shale Basin it overlies shales of a similar lithology which have been assigned to the Majeau Lake Member of the Cooking Lake Formation. It is the lateral equivalent of dark euxinic shales of the Perdrix Formation of the Rocky Mountains. South of the Peace River Arch it may be equated to a thin development overlying the Waterways Formation.  History: The name was first applied by well-site geologists to describe the brown bituminous shales found in wells drilled in the Duvernay area of east-central Alberta. Originally proposed in 1950 as a member of the Woodbend Formation. Recommended to the geologic names and correlations committee of the Alberta Society of Petroleum Geologists for elevation to formation status by Andrichuk and Wonfor (1954, p. 2505).",Alberta,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/004000/GSCC00053004342.html,21
29671,Maligne,Frasnian,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: The Maligne Formation consists of thin-bedded, dark grey to black argillaceous lime mudstones which weather rubbly and recessive. In some sections the Maligne Formation contains thin shaly stringers every few decimetres in addition to the overall argillaceous character of the limestones. Brachiopods and crinoids are common in the Maligne, particularly toward the top of the formation. In proximity to carbonate buildups of the Fairholme Group the lithology and fossil content become more varied. Skeletal wackestones and even rare packstones containing crinoids, brachiopods, gastropods and cephalopods, together with buildup-derived calcareous algae, thamnoporid coral and stromatoporoid fragments are common. Peloid and intraclast wackestones also occur near the buildup margins. The upper Maligne Formation also exhibits some burrowed or bored horizons, and pyrite nodules are frequently seen on these bedding planes.  Distribution: The Maligne Formation is 15.8 m (52 ft) thick at the type section and generally varies between 12 and 30 m (39 and 98 ft) thick, with the maximum development adjacent to Fairholme carbonate buildup margins. The Maligne is recognized in basinal sections of Fairholme Group in the Rocky Mountains, from the Cecilia and Kakwa Lakes area of northeastern British Columbia to the Cline River area in the south, a distance of 300 km (186 mi). The Maligne Formation thins away from buildup margins and appears to be absent in some basin sections (e.g., Mountjoy, 1965; Belyea, 1978, fig. 2). Stratigraphic and facies relationships suggest that the Maligne Formation occurs as broad halos surrounding carbonate buildups (Coppold, 1976; Mountjoy and Mackenzie, 1973).  Type Locality: Cold Sulphur Spring, roadside exposure along Highway 16, 21 km (13 mi) north of Jasper townsite. (53 deg 03'N, 118 deg 05'W)  Locality Data: Thickness(m): Minimum 12, Maximum 30, Typical 15.8.  Relationship: The Maligne Formation overlies the Flume Formation with a sharp (possibly paraconformable) contact, and is conformably overlain by the Perdrix Formation. In the Jasper area the Maligne Formation grades laterally to the base of the upper member of the Cairn Formation of the carbonate buildups. Due to the recessive weathering of the Maligne this transition is often hidden in outcrop sections. Where seen the Maligne may interfinger with Cairn dolomite tongues or grade smoothly into dark Cairn dolomites. The Maligne Formation thins into the basin and may be absent in some basin sections located far from carbonate buildups. This lateral relationship apparently does not hold in the extreme northwest. Maurin and Raasch (1972), on the basis of paleontologic evidence favor the original assignment of Maligne-type facies as a 'lateral shaly equivalent of upper Flume carbonates' (p. 14) and reject formation status for the unit. However, the Flume Formation in northeastern British Columbia is probably older than more southerly exposures and it seems reasonable for Maligne-type sediments to be lateral equivalents of either uppermost Flume or basal Cairn carbonates, depending upon their position in the basin. The subsurface equivalent of the Maligne Formation in the plains to the east is the Duvernay Formation.  History: Formerly the upper member of the Flume Formation of Raymond (1930), it was raised to formation status and named the Maligne by Taylor (1957) because its lithology differs distinctly from that of the underlying beds. Taylor designated Cold Sulphur Spring as the type section and used the earlier description of this section by Fox (1954) to define the formation.",Alberta British Columbia,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/009000/GSCC00053009056.html,21
29674,Muskwa,Frasnian,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: Black bituminous shale with abundant pyrite.  Distribution: It is 37 m (120 ft) thick in the type well, which is typical. Present in northern Alberta, northeastern British Columbia and southern Northwest Territories.  Type Locality: Western National Gas et al. Fort Nelson a-95-J, 94-J-10, near Fort Nelson, British Columbia, between 1,986 and 2,022 m (6,510 and 6,630 ft).

South and east of the Slave Point carbonate front the Muskwa overlies the Slave Point Formation; still further south and east the Muskwa overlies the Waterways Formation (previously Beaverhill Lake Formation). Griffin (1965) proposed formation status; in the opinion of Griffin (1965), Bassett and Stout (1967) and others the base of the Muskwa is a widespread erosional unconformity.

29714,Wabamun,Famennian,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: The group consists of dolomitic limestones and calcareous dolomites, with the limestones predominating in the upper part of the formation and dolomites in the middle and lower parts. Appreciable interbedded anhydrite occurs, which forms a prominent zone near the base of the formation in some areas (Leduc field). In the Stettler area and southeastward halite maybe interbedded with these anhydrites. In a trend from Olds south to Okotoks interbedded anhydrite and dolomite occur in both the upper and lower portion of the group, with the variably porous Crossfield Member dolomites occurring in between. In northwestern Alberta the Wabamun is wholly limestone. Brecciation, secondary anhydrite and calcite veining are common. At the upper contact with the Exshaw the limestone may be highly pyritic.  Distribution: The thickness varies from zero to 240 m (787 ft). From the wedge-edge in east-central Alberta, where it is truncated at the post-Paleozoic erosional surface the Wabamun increases in thickness westward towards the foothills. It is present throughout the Alberta Plains subsurface. The term has been used interchangeably with the Palliser Formation in foothills fields as far south as Waterton.  Type Locality: The type section is in Anglo Canadian Wabamun Lake No. 1 well, in 5-10-51-4W5M, Alberta, between 1,748.0 and 1,919.3 m (5,735 and 6,297 ft).  Locality Data: WELL 100051005104W500; WABAMUN NO.1.  Thickness(m): Minimum 0, Maximum 240.  Interval(m): From 1748, To 1919.3.  Relationship: In the Stettler area of Alberta the Wabamun was divided by Wonfor and Andrichuk (1956) into the Big Valley and Stettler formations. The Wabamun Group rests on dolomitic and anhydritic siltstones of the Graminia Formation of the Winterburn Group. In the western and southern parts of the area, where erosion has not removed the Mississippian beds the Wabamun is disconformably overlain by bituminous shales of the Exshaw Format on, elsewhere it is overlain by sandstones and shales of the Lower Cretaceous Blairmore or Mannville Group. The Wabamun is correlative with the middle part of the Three Forks Formation of Montana, with the Palliser Formation of the Rocky Mountains, and with the Kotcho and Tetcho formations of the northeastern British Columbia, which lose their identity westward into shales of the Besa River Formation.  History: The Wabamun was originally described as the 'D-1 zone' (and included the upper part of the 'anhydrite zone' in the Leduc field from the Imperial Leduc No. 3 well, in 10-26-50-26W4M (Layer et al., 1949). Later the unit was named the Wabamun Formation (Imperial Oil Staff, 1950) and raised to group status (Wonfor and Andrichuk, 1956).",Alberta,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/015000/GSCC00053015910.html,21
29849,Kindle,Asselian - early Artinskian,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: The thin to medium bedded Kindle is dominated by rhythmically interbedded, calcareous silt shale and medium to dark grey calcareous to dolomitic, sandy siltstone and silty limestone. Containing locally abundant brachiopods and pelmatozoan ossicles. Conglomerate is commonly present at the base of the anomalously radioactive basal facies. Coarsening-upward sequences of shale, siltstone and cross-bedded sandstone are widely present in the northeast. The deposits are slightly glauconitic and commonly contain phosphate nodules and pellets. Shale becomes less abundant upward and northeastward as the proportion of sandstone and siltstone increases. Beds in the lower and western Kindle are commonly sharp based and show planar laminae and small to medium scale cross-bedding (McMechan, 1987; Henderson et al., in press). Three units constitute the Kindle Formation in the Racing River synclinorium and the Cariboo Range (Laudon and Chronic, 1949; Bamber et al., 1968). The lower unit consists of dark grey siltstone with thin shale interbeds and some lenticular beds of calcareous siltstone. Between the Liard River and the Caribou Range this lower unit also contains beds of calcareous sandstone and sandy limestone. The banded middle unit comprises alternating dark grey argillaceous siltstone and orange weathering, calcareous and dolomitic, pyritic siltstone. Lenses of silty limestone lie within the middle unit in some sections. The upper unit comprises dark grey, siliceous mudstone, shale and chert. A sequence of siltstone, sandstone, shale and brachiopod-bearing limestones correlative with the lower and middle units is widespread in the foothills from the Toad River south to the Pine Pass.  Distribution: The Kindle Formation, preserved in the eastern Cordillera and subsurface of the northwestern Interior Platform is locally exposed in the mountains and foothills from southwestern District of Mackenzie to Mountain Creek south of Pine Pass, east-central British Columbia (Bamber, et al., 1968; McMechan, 1987; Henderson et al., in press). It ranges from 90 to (295 ft) to more than 200 m (610 ft) in the Racing River synclinorium and Cariboo Range of the eastern Rocky Mountains. In the Western foothills north of Tuchodi River the formation is commonly more than 100 m (328 ft) thick. South of Tuchodi River it is generally between 15 to 75 m (49 and 246 ft) thick. The eastward thinning Kindle is truncated by the sub-Fantasque and sub-Triassic unconformities at several localities in the eastern foothills and western plains (Bamber et al., 1968; Henderson et al., in press).  Type Locality: Ridge on east side of small, unnamed tributary of Toad River, about 1.4 km (0.9 mi) southwest of mouth of Nonda Creek and 0.8 km (0.5 mi) south of mile post 428 (689 km) on Alaska Highway; 58 deg 50'21'N, 125 deg 21'25'W; NTS 94K/14; Muskwa Ranges, eastern Rocky Mountains, northeastern British Columbia (Laudon and Chronic, 1949, p. 193).  Relationship: The Kindle unconformably overlies the Lower Carboniferous Mattson Formation in the northwest and the Lower Carboniferous Stoddart Group or underlying Prophet Formation to the southeast. The Kindle closely resembles the upper Stoddart, and much of what has been mapped as Kindle is probably assignable to the Stoddart. Triassic siltstone locally overlies the Kindle in the foothills and eastern Rocky Mountains, but the Permian Fantasque Formation unconformably overlies the Kindle in most areas. The upper Kindle of the type area may pass eastward into the Fantasque Formation. The Kindle, homotaxial with the subsurface Belloy Formation of Peace River Embayment, is partly coeval with the Belcourt Formation of east-central British Columbia (Bamber and Macqueen, 1979), but the nature of the contact with the latter is uncertain.  History: Originally defined (Laudon and Chronic, 1949, p. 210) to include the entire interval between the Besa River Formation and the Triassic in the Racing River synclinorium; restricted by Sutherland (1958, p. 31) to exclude bedded chert and black shale of the Permian Fantasque Formation in the Tetsa River Valley to the east.

Thin- to indistinctly bedded and characteristically contains thin regular to slightly crenulated light grey laminations. Siltstone as lenticular to nodular incalations which locally are very calcareous. Base characterized at many localities by phosphatic sandstone and/or phosphatic pebble conglomerate, the latter composed of very irregular to elongate, angular to well rounded pebbles of cellophane up to 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter and up to 10 cm (4 in) long. The Whistler Member forms a distinctive marker in the Sulphur Mountain Formation because of its dark grey and recessive weathering character, and contained grains and pebbles of collophane.  Distribution: The unit is confined mainly to the Rocky Mountain front ranges between Bow and Pine rivers, Alberta and northeastern British Columbia, but also occurs in the Foothills and part of the plains area. It is not recognized south of Bow River, with exception of Spray River Gorge, nor in the Alberta Foothills between Athabasca and Bow rivers because of easterly syndepositional thinning and probable facies change to lithologies of the Llama Member. The member ranges in measured thickness from a minimum of 4 m (13 ft) on Mount Greenock, Jasper National Park to a maximum of 85 m (279 ft) at Watson Peak, near Burnt River, northeastern British Columbia.  Type Locality: On the southwest limb of the prominent anticline near the headwaters of Whistler Creek, a tributary of Sulphur River, west-central Alberta. SE/4 Sec. 11, Twp. 54, Rge. 8W6M. Hardscrabble Creek NTS 83E/11E.  Relationship: The Whistler is abruptly underlain by resistant, rusty brown weathering siltstone of the Vega Siltstone Member. It is overlain abruptly in most areas by resistant weathering massive siltstone and silty dolostone of the Llama Member. In some areas the contact is gradational and placed at the base of an interval where more resistant, paler grey weathering and thicker bedded siltstone of the Llama forms the predominant lithology. The Whistler Member loses its distinctive recessive weathering character in exposures north of the Pine River, northeastern British Columbia. The contact between the Montney and overlying Doig formations in the subsurface Peace River Plains is equivalent to the base of the Whistler Member and corresponds to a marked increase or reflection trace on gamma-ray neutron log records. The Whistler is equivalent to the lower part of the Doig, and part of the Toad formations of the plains and foothills of northeastern British Columbia.

In the Sukunka River area the member contains interbeds of silty and bioclastic limestone.  Distribution: The unit occurs in most areas of the Rocky Mountain Foothills and front ranges between the Pine and Bow rivers. The member ranges in measured thickness from a minimum of 3 m (10 ft) at Fiddle River, Jasper National Park, to a maximum of 357 m (1,171 ft) on West Burnt River, near Pine Pass, northeastern British Columbia. In eastern exposures, south of Bow River the member is sporadic in occurrence because of Pre-Jurassic and Pleistocene-Recent erosion and accordingly thins to zero.

NTS 83E/14W Grande Cache.  Relationship: The Llama Member is gradationally overlain by yellow weathering sandstone, dolostone and intraformational and/or solution breccia of the Charlie Lake Formation in the Pine-Sukunka River area of northeastern British Colombia (Gibson, 1975), and the Starlight Evaporite Member of the Whitehorse Formation between the Sukunka and Bow rivers. Between the Bow River and Crowsnest Pass the unit is disconformably overlain in some areas by black shales of the Jurassic Fernie Formation (Gibson, 1969). In the subsurface plains of northeastern British Columbia and west-central Alberta the Llama grades laterally into pale grey sandstone of the Halfway Formation. The Llama Member is underlain gradationally or abruptly by dark grey thin- to medium-bedded siltstone and silty limestone of the Whistler Member in most areas, or rusty brown weathering siltstones of the Vega Siltstone Member in the Cadomin area and some areas south of Bow River where the Whistler is absent due to possible facies change into strata typical of the Llama Member. The Llama Member is equivalent to the Halfway, upper Doig and Liard and upper Toad formations of the foothills and plains of northeastern British Columbia.  History: The facies was first recognized and described by Manko (1960) in the Rock Lake area and named the 'Upper Siltstone Member'.

Siltstones and fine-grained sandstone interbeds occur in the upper 20 m (66 ft); and 2) Anne Creek Member, resistant, rusty weathering sandstone containing Erycitoides, locally developed and equivalent to the upper sandstones elsewhere.  Distribution: It is widespread in the Richardson Mountains and western Mackenzie Delta north of approximately 67 deg 45'N. It thickens northwestward, from 52 m (170 ft) near the head of Martin Creek (68 deg 05'40'N, 136 deg 11'30'W) to at least 124 m (407 ft) near the head of Waters River (67 deg 45'N, 137 deg 19'W).

29966,Rock Creek,Bajocian,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: As defined by Warren (1934) at the type locality the Rock Creek Member consists of resistant, grey to grey-brown quartzose siltstone and sandstones; quartz grains subrounded to subangular, with calcite cement, sometimes poikilotopic, which increases in amount towards the base of the unit. Parallel bedded, with individual beds averaging 5 cm (2 in) thick, becoming thicker up to 10 cm (4 in) and coarser toward the top of the unit. Wavy lamination is common and represents the only internal structure. The top of the Rock Creek Member is marked by two beds of coarser sandstone with pebbles, small phosphatic pellets oxidized pyritic masses and poorly preserved bivalves; the lower of these beds is 0.6 m (2 ft) thick, the higher 0.9 m (3 ft). Farther north, at Livingstone Gap and Sheep River the unit is more platy-bedded and silty, with individual beds 3 cm (1.2 in) thick. Around Cadomin and in northern parts of Jasper Park (in Morris Creek, Fiddle River and Snake Indian River), at approximately this stratigraphic level there occur sandstones containing abundant bivalves, belemnites and ammonites of the 'Teloceras fauna' which have been regarded as representing the 'Rock Creek Member' sensu stricto (Frebold, 1957), i.e., as originally defined by Warren. If this correlation is accepted the Rock Creek Member in the northern foothills and front ranges is younger than around the type locality in the southern foothills; it is absent from Fernie sections between these areas, where the Highwood Member sits directly on the Poker Chip Shale. At Cadomin this unit consists of a single resistant, dark grey sandstone, heavily bioturbated and weathering orange-brown; to the west, in Fiddle River and Morris Creek three thinner, but otherwise similar bioturbated sandstones are interbedded with dark grey shales, and farther west at Snake Indian River the sandstones are represented by thin, calcareous, resistant beds with much thicker shale interbeds. The Rock Creek Member has been traced east of the Jasper area in the subsurface, where it is up to 37 m (121 ft) thick and consists of a basal coquinoid sandstone overlain by burrowed, silty sandstones with clean, flaser bedded, cross-bedded and planar laminated to wave-rippled sandstones at the top (Marion, 1984).  Type Locality: Headwaters of Rock Creek, on east slopes of Livingstone Range, about 6 km (3.8 mi) northeast of Frank, Alberta; grid reference 918994, NTS Blairmore 82 G/9.  History: Warren (1934) proposed the name Rock Creek Member for a marker horizon of calcareous sandstone, 1.5 to 9.1 m (5 to 30 ft) thick, which was 15 to 45 m (49 to 148 ft) above the base of the Fernie. Later in the same paper (p. 66, 67) Warren referred to a rich and distinctive fauna with Bajocian ammonites (including Teloceras, Stephanoceras, Stemmatoceras and Chondroceras) and bivalves, which has since been known as the ' Teloceras fauna', as occurring in the Rock Creek Member. In fact, at the type locality ammonites representing the so-called ' Teloceras fauna' are found in large, calcareous concretions interbedded with dark grey, rusty weathering shales (now placed in the Highwood Member) some 15 m (49 ft) above the calcareous sandstone. Quartz sandstones and siltstones equivalent to the Rock Creek Member as defined by Warren occur at a number of localities in southwestern Alberta: Daisy Creek, Livingstone Gap, and above Burns' Mine on Sheep River. In each case the 'Teloceras fauna' occurs some distance above the siltstone unit and has not been found within it. The name Rock Creek Member came to be used subsequently for a sequence of dark grey, rusty weathering shales with concretions and beds of sandy shales or dark limestones containing abundant bivalves, ammonites and belemnites of the 'Teloceras fauna' (Frebold, 1957). More recently (Frebold, 1976) the member was expanded stratigraphically downward to include a calcareous sandstone with Sonninia along with grey to greyish brown, rusty weathering shales with concretions immediately underlying this sandstone. As thus defined the Rock Creek Member includes all Fernie strata Iying between the Poker Chip Shale (Toarcian) and the Grey Beds (Bathonian) and which have yielded faunas of Bajocian age. Thus the Rock Creek Member, initially defined as a lithostratigraphic marker horizon has been expanded to include a diversity of lithologies and would be defined on the basis of the contained ammonite faunas, i.e. it has become a biostratigraphic unit. The original usage, sensu Warren should be reestablished for the Rock Creek Member.",Alberta British Columbia,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/012000/GSCC00053012885.html,21

The shales are generally calcareous or marly and fossiliferous with coalified plant fragments and rare pyrite. The sandstones (3-9 m thick) are fine-grained, cemented by silica or calcite, and may contain carbonized plant material. Limestone units (3-6 m thick) are composed of argillaceous to sandy pelecypod mudstone and wackestone. Interbedded fluvial sandstones and conglomerates found in Chevron et al. Hibernia P-15 (46 deg 44'58.98'N, 48 deg 46'51.18'W) on the Grand Banks have been informally designated the Jeanne d'Arc member by Arthur et al. (1982). Deposition of the Mic Mac Formation occurred in a shallow marine, in part nearshore, environment.  Distribution: In the type section well, the Mic Mac Formation is 1,296 m thick. It reaches thicknesses of 1335 m in the Scotian Basin. Arthur et al. (1982) included Upper Jurassic shales, sandstones, and limestones of the East Newfoundland Basin in the Mic Mac Formation.

Relationship: The lower contract is known only where the Mic Mac Formation overlies the Scatarie Member of the Abenaki Formation. It is conformably overlain by the sands of the Lower Cretaceous Missisauga Formation of the Nova Scotia Group. The Mic Mac Formation is laterally equivalent to the Middle Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous Mohawk and Verrill Canyon formations. It is interpreted to be an updip facies of the Baccaro Member of the Middle Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous Abenaki Formation. The Western Bank Group includes the Mohawk, Abenaki, Mic Mac, and Verrill Canyon formations.  History: The name for the formation comes from the North American Indians inhabiting Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland, namely the Micmac Indians. The spelling, Mic Mac, given by McIver (1972), Shell Canada, has been perpetuated in the literature.",Offshore east coast,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/009000/GSCC00053009688.html,21
29993,Waskada,Oxfordian,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: The unit changes laterally and vertically within short distances. Shales predominate but vary in color: green, bentonitic shales are common, and grey to black, slightly carbonaceous shales also occur, as well as traces of red shale and ironstone. Thin beds and lenses of sandstone are common, and are white, fine- to very fine-grained, calcareous, and commonly pyritic and glauconitic.  Distribution: The Waskada occurs as an erosional wedge-edge; it is a subsurface unit defined for southwestern Manitoba and does not extend to outcrop. It is present as far north as the Virden area (vicinity of Twp. 12). Its maximum thickness in Manitoba is 57.9 m (190 ft); equivalent strata in North Dakota attain a maximum thickness of about 90 m (295 ft). Waskada beds locally show sharp changes in thickness due to deeply incised pre-Cretaceous channels that have locally eroded through the Waskada into the underlying Melita Formation. The depth of channels is as much as 76 m (249 ft).  Type Locality: No type section indicated, but the thickest section occurs in the general vicinity of Waskada, Manitoba (Twp. 2, Rge. 25WPM). One of the thickest sections reported by Stott is in the Souris Valley et al. McKague 27-2 well, in 2-27-1-27WPM, between 661.4 and 716.3 m (2,170 and 2,350 ft).  Locality Data: Thickness(m): Minimum 0, Maximum 57.9.  Relationship: The unit is underlain conformably by variegated shales of the Melita Formation, and is overlain with marked unconformity by coarse sands of the basal Cretaceous Swan River (Blairmore) Formation, except along its northern edge, where the Swan River strata pinch out and Waskada beds are directly overlain by grey shales of the Ashville Formation. It correlates with the upper Vanguard (Masefield Shale) of Saskatchewan, and with the Swift and possibly the Morrison formations of North Dakota.",Manitoba,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/016000/GSCC00053016096.html,21
30002,Cummings,Early Cretaceous,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: Nauss (1945) described the Cummings member as principally dark grey to black shale containing abundant pyrite and foraminifera. Beds of salt-and-pepper sandstone are common and a coal seam occurs near the base in the type section. To the south and east, and in the Lloydminster area the Cummings is a clean, bar-type sandstone and the term Cummings is more often used in relation to this sandstone than the shales described by Nauss.  Distribution: Thickness varies from zero to 27.5 m (90 ft) in the type area and thins to the south. The member thickens to the north and is probably equivalent, in part to the Clearwater Shale, which is about 80 m (275 ft) thick on the Athabasca River. The Cummings Member can be differentiated from rocks above and below it by the presence of characteristic foraminifera in its shales. It can be correlated to the Ostracod Zone in centraI Alberta.  Type Locality: Northwest Mannville No. 1 well, in Lsd. 1, Sec 18, Twp. 50, Rge. 8W4M, Alberta, between 642.5 and 688.5 m (2,108 and 2,193 ft).

30065,McCloud,Aptian - Albian,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: Comprises 7 m (23 ft) of capping claystone, lignitic to carbonaceous, black to grey black, which grades downward into 2 m (7 ft) of quartzose, silty and very fine, sandy, calcareous mudstone with patches or glauconite, weakly bedded, bioturbated, and floored by a basal conglomerate of angular mudstone; 3.6 m (12 ft) of mudstone, medium grey, silty, slightly calcareous and foraminiferal, resting with a sharp irregular contact on 3.9 m (13 ft) of sandstone, quartzose, fine-grained, faintly flat-bedded to trough cross-bedded. Upper 0.6 m (2 ft) is impregnated with pyrite projecting fingerlike from the contact. Remainder of sandstone is infilled with white kaolinite and is conglomeratic toward base.  Distribution: Unit occupies the thalweg of the pre-Cantuar valley system, which may range in width from 0.8 to 10 km (0.5 to 6.3 mi) and is generally radial from off the Swift Current paleoupland toward eastern Saskatchewan (Christopher, 1984b, fig. 5). Thickness is of the order of 0.15 to 45 m (0.5 to 148 ft).  Type Locality: Named from the cored section in the Amurex-Albercan McCloud 1-15 well, in 15-12-10-27W3M, near Maple Creek, southwestern Saskatchewan, between 1,119 and 1,136 m (3,670 and 3,726 ft).  Relationship: The McCloud is the basal member of the Cantuar Formation. Eastward it is traceable into the Dina sandstone and the Cummings-Lloydminster members (shales and mudstones) of the Mannville Formation. It is equated with the Third Cat Creek sandstone of central Montana and the Cut Bank sandstone of northwestern Montana.",Saskatchewan,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/009000/GSCC00053009410.html,21
30074,Swan River,Albian,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: Mainly a fine grained sand or sandstone, with silts and light to dark grey clays. In the type locality the lowest exposures are of kaolinitic clays and silts associated with minor amounts of fine grained sand, pyrite nodules and carbonized plant fragments. The upper type beds consist of fine, clean sands with interbedded dark clay and are distinguished by flaser bedding and a variety of biogenic sedimentary structures. The uppermost sands are richly glauconitic (up to 25 per cent).  Distribution: The name Swan River has been applied only in the vicinity of the Manitoba escarpment and in the neighbouring subsurface of eastern Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba. Its thickness is highly variable, ranging from near zero around the Virden area of Manitoba (Bannatyne, 1970), to a maximum of about 150 m (492 ft) in some areas west of the Manitoba escarpment. Due to incomplete exposure its thickness along the escarpment is not precisely known.  Type Locality: Exposures along the Swan River, east of Swan River, Manitoba, between Secs. 3 and 6, Twp. 37, Rge. 26WPM.  Locality Data: Thickness(m): Minimum 0, Maximum 150.  Relationship: The lower contact is not exposed, but in the subsurface the Swan River oversteps in succession, from the southwest to the northeast rocks of Jurassic, Devonian, Silurian and Ordovician age. At the type locality the upper contact with dark shale of the Ashville Formation is sharp and locally scoured. In eastern Saskatchewan the Swan River-Ashville contact maintains a fairly constant stratigraphic position, but towards the escarpment in southeastern Manitoba the contact rises markedly. The formation correlates westwards with the Cantuar and Pense formations of the Mannville Group in Saskatchewan, with the Mannville Group of southern and central Alberta, and with a part of the Blairmore Group of the Alberta Foothills. Southward it correlates with the Lakota Sandstone, Fuson Shale and Fall River Sandstone in North Dakota.  History: The rank of the Swan River has been changed from group to formation by McNeil and Caldwell (1981).",Manitoba Saskatchewan,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/014000/GSCC00053014808.html,21
30084,Joli Fou,middle Albian,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: Dark grey, noncalcareous shale, with minor interbedded fine- and medium-grained sandstone. The sandstone occurs as lenses, commonly a few millimetres thick and as graded layers up to several centimetres in thickness, composed of horizontal or very gently inclined laminae. Bioturbated, shaly sandstones form scarce layers several centimetres thick. In the upper part of the unit the interbedded sandstone is quartzose and micaceous, while near the base glauconitic sandstone and quartz arenite are common. Subordinate lithologies include bentonite, pelecypod coquinas, nodular phosphorite and concretionary layers of calcite, siderite and pyrite. In central Saskatchewan the unit consists of interbedded glauconitic sandstone and noncalcareous mudstone of the Spinney Hill Sandstone, overlain by northward thinning Joli Fou shales of much reduced thickness. The Joli Fou Formation includes, at its base the interbedded shady sandstone, siltstone and mudstone of the Cessford (Basal Colorado) Sand in southeastern Alberta.  Distribution: The unit is about 33.5 m (110 ft) thick in the Athabasca River exposures, thinning to about 10.7 m (35 ft) to the south of the Lesser Slave Lake area and to about 16.8 m (55 ft) in the Redwater area. The Joli Fou Formation attains a thickness of about 61 m (200 ft) in south-central Saskatchewan. The sequence pinches out in the Rocky Mountain Foothills of southern Alberta, where it is replaced by the lowermost sandstones of the Bow Island Formation. The unit is of widespread distribution in the subsurface of the Western Canada sedimentary basin.  Type Locality: Along the Athabasca River, between Pelican Rapids and 8 km (5 mi) downstream from Joli Fou Rapids. Joli Fou Section No. 1 is located about 5.5 km (3.4 mi) below Joli Fou Rapids, in NW/ 4 Sec. 22, or SW/4 Sec. 27, Twp. 81, Rge. 17W4M. Joli Fou Section No. 2 is in the north-central part of a series of exposures some 61 m (200 ft) east of the river in the west-central part of Sec. 33, Twp. 81, Rge. 17W4M. Joli Fou Section No. 3 is in an exposure about 8 km (5 mi) downstream from Joli Fou Rapids, on the east side of the valley in NW/4 Sec. 35, Twp 82, Rge 17W4M, some 42.7 m (140 ft) above the river.  Relationship: The Joli Fou Formation is the basal unit of the Colorado Group. In northeastern Alberta it rests on the Grand Rapids Formation of the Mannville Group and is overlain by the Pelican Formation in southern Alberta and southern Saskatchewan. Joli Fou shales rest disconformably on the Pense Formation and equivalent sandstones, marking the top of the Blairmore- Mannville-Swan River sequence, and are overlain by sandstones of the Bow Island-Viking succession. The Viking-Joli Fou contact is a disconformity in west-central Saskatchewan. Where the Viking Formation is absent in parts of southern Saskatchewan the Joli Fou and Big River formations form a sequence of undifferentiated lower Colorado shale. In central Saskatchewan the top of the Joli Fou Formation is defined by a sharp contact with the overlying Flotten Lake Sand. The Joli Fou Formation corresponds to the lower part of the lower Ashville succession (Skull Creek Member) in southern Manitoba and is equivalent to the Skull Creek Shale of north-central Montana and North Dakota. It is equivalent to the Taft Hill and Flood members of the Blackleaf Formation of northern Montana.  History: Originally designated Pelican shale by McConnell (1892), which usage was continued by McLearn (1917). The name was changed by Wickenden (1949) to avoid confusion with the overlying Pelican sandstone succession.",Alberta Saskatchewan,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/007000/GSCC00053007217.html,21
30090,Spinney Hill,middle Albian,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: Greyish green and dusky yellowish green, very fine- to coarse-grained glauconitic sandstone with interbedded, dark grey, noncalcareous shale and mudstone. Typically the succession is for the most part made up of vertically repeated fining-upward sequences, each of which is several metres thick and composed of cross-laminated sandstone with minor intercalated shale, replaced upwards by regular alternations of sandstone and shale. In central Saskatchewan the Spinney Hill Member includes only minor amounts of interbedded shale, but the proportion of shale increases progressively southward. Bioturbated, shaly, glauconitic sandstone occurs in layers up to a few decimetres thick. Scarce intraformational conglomerates also occur. Reworked relict pebbles of nodular phosphorite form local concentrations. Other subordinate lithologies include pelecypod coquinas and concretionary layers of siderite and pyrite.  Distribution: The Spinney Hill Member forms a prominent tongue of sandy strata extending southwards from the southwestern margin of Prince Albert National Park, to the west of and parallel to the South Saskatchewan River, shaling out to the north of swift Current. This tongue is about 60 km (37.5 mi) wide. The unit ranges in thickness from about 12.2 to 36.6 m (40 to 120 ft), with an average value of 18.3 m (60 ft).  Type Locality: Name first applied by F.H. Edmunds to the glauconitic sandstone unit occupying the lower part of the Joli Fou Formation in the Spinney Hill No. 1 well, in 16-24-40-14W3M, near Spinney Hill, Saskatchewan. The type well, designated by Edwards (1960), is the Liberal Canada Southern New Devon Skyline No. 2 well, in 3-6-37-16W3M.  Locality Data: WELL 121030603716W300; LIBERAL ET AL PALO 3 6 37 16.  Thickness(m): Minimum 12.2, Maximum 36.6, Typical 18.3.  Relationship: In central Saskatchewan the unit subcrops beneath a Pleistocene drift cover of variable thickness. Farther south the contact with the overlying Joli Fou shales and mudstones is gradational as is the relationship between the sandstone tongue and the flanking argillaceous deposits. The unit rests disconformably on sandstones and shales of the Mannville Group.",Saskatchewan,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/014000/GSCC00053014248.html,21
30104,Big River,Cenomanian,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: Dark grey noncalcareous shale and mudstone of variable fissility, with minor interbedded, fine- and medium-grained sandstone and coarse-grained siltstone. The sandstone and siltstone occur as lenses, commonly a few millimetres thick, and as graded layers up to several centimetres in thickness, composed of horizontal or very gently inclined laminae. Bioturbated, shaly sandstones and siltstones form relatively scarce layers, up to several centimetres thick. Sand grade pelecypod debris, notably calcite prisms of Inoceramus, and fish skeletal material form skeletal calcarenites and phosphatic sandstones respectively, which occur in common layers, similar in structure to those of siliciclastic composition. Thin layers of chert pebbles also occur. Subordinate lithologies include bentonite, nodular phosphorite and concretionary layers of siderite, calcite and pyrite; Price and Ball (1971) have observed veins of barite up to 12 mm (0.5 in) wide. In southern Saskatchewan and southern and central Alberta the unit consists chiefly of shales and incorporates the interbedded fish-skeletal sandstones and mudstones of the Fish Scale Sandstone, which thins northeastward and is not present in central Saskatchewan. In west-central Saskatchewan, to the north of the North Saskatchewan River the lower half of the Big River Formation includes interbedded kaolinitic and shaly sandstones and noncalcareous mudstone of the northeastward thickening St. Walburg Sandstone; in east-central Saskatchewan the unit incorporates kaolinitic sandstone and noncalcareous mudstone of the northward thickening Okla Sandstone. Elongate megaspores, commonly tightly packed in thin layers characterize the upper part of the Big River Formation above the Fish Scale Sandstone and in stratigraphically equivalent parts of the unit where the latter is not recognized.  Distribution: The Big River Formation attains a maximum thickness of 150 m (492 ft) in southwestern Saskatchewan, thinning to about 42.7 m (140 ft) in east-central Saskatchewan. The unit also thins markedly in the Rocky Mountain Foothills of southern Alberta, where it is replaced to a large extent by the uppermost sandstones of the Bow Island Formation, which is succeeded by a thick Fish Scale Sandstone sequence. The Big River succession is of widespread distribution in the subsurface of the western Canada Sedimentary Basin.  Type Locality: The unit takes its name from the Big River Provincial Forest region of west-central Saskatchewan, where it exhibits greatest lithologic variation. The type section is from 376 to 447.4 m (1,233.5 to 1,468 ft) in the Duval Saskatoon 6-18-36-6W3M well in central Saskatchewan. Two incomplete reference sections have also been designated: from 105.2 to ca. 180.4 m (345 to ca. 592 ft) in the D.N.R. Flotten Lake No. 2 well (Lsd. 4-10-65-17W3M) in west-central Saskatchewan and from 334.1 to 352.7 m (1,096 to 1,157 ft) in the Imperial Okla 1-29-35-8W2M well in east-central Saskatchewan.  Relationship: The Big River Formation is conformable upon and makes gradational contact with the underlying Bow Island-Viking succession of southern Alberta and western Saskatchewan, and the Newcastle-Viking sequence upon which it rests in eastern Saskatchewan. In west-central Saskatchewan, north of the North Saskatchewan River the unit is lithologically gradational with the underlying Flotten Lake Sand. The Big River Formation is disconformably overlain by calcareous shales and shaly chalks of the Second White-speckled shale and lithologically similar equivalent strata. This contact is for the most part sharply defined, both lithologically and on geophysical well logs, and is commonly used as a subsurface datum. In central Saskatchewan, where the Big River Formation in places is succeeded by a single white-speckled shale the disconformity is particularly pronounced, in that the Fish Scale Sandstone and overlying Big River Shale are not present (Caldwell et al., 1978). The appearance of successively younger strata above the disconformity in a basinward direction (North and Caldwell, 1975a; Simpson, 1975) further limits the time significance of this correlation surface. In parts of southwestern Saskatchewan the Big River Formation is overlain by shaly sandstones and siltstones of the Phillips Sandstone. However, in adjacent north-central Montana the lowermost Phillips lithologies occupy the uppermost part of the Belle Fourche Formation which, together with the underlying Mowry Formation is equivalent to the Big River succession. In southern Manitoba the Big River sequence is represented by noncalcareous, variably bituminous shales referable to the upper part of the Ashville Formation. In northern Alberta the Big River has equivalents in the Sunkay Member of the Blackstone and Kaskapau formations, and lower Labiche Formation.  History: The first detailed description of the entire unit is by Price and Ball (1971), who referred to it as 'unnamed beds', penetrated by the Duval Corporation Potash Shaft No. 1 (Lsd. 6-18-36-6W3M) at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.",Alberta Saskatchewan,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/001000/GSCC00053001318.html,21
30106,Ashville,Albian - Cenomanian,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: Grey-black, noncalcareous shale with subordinate amounts of silt, sand and calcarenite. At the base the Skull Creek Member consists of shale with minor amounts of sand, siltstone, rare phosphatic nodules and disseminated pyrite. Glauconitic sand lenses are common in its lowermost part. The overlying Newcastle Member (previously the informal Ashville sand) is made up of fine-grained sand, silt and clay. The Westgate Member is a uniform shale with rare beds of silty shale with sandy lenses. The Belle Fourche, the uppermost member of the Ashville is predominantly a black carbonaceous shale which is marked in its lowermost part by lenses and laminae of silt and fish fragments constituting the regional Fish-scale marker beds. The upper Belle Fourche contains minor units of calcarenite, one of which forms the Ostrea beloiti beds associated with a regional marker bentonite bed which, with the oyster bearing calcarenite forms a widespread marker unit in the eastern part of the Western Interior of Canada and the United States.  Distribution: The Ashville Formation is applied only in western Manitoba and eastern Saskatchewan. It is 50 to 80 m (164 to 262 ft) thick in the Manitoba escarpment; about 100 m (328 ft) thick in eastern Saskatchewan.  Type Locality: On the Wilson River, in Twp. 25, Rges. 20 and 21W1M, near Ashville Manitoba. A composite type section on the Wilson River has been described by McNeil and Caldwell (1981).  Relationship: The Ashville rests with sharp contact on the white sands of the Swan River Formation. The contact rises stratigraphically southeastward as the Skull Creek Member diminishes in thickness. The upper contact with calcareous, chalk-speckled shale of the Favel Formation is conformable in southeastern Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba, but sharp and unconformable to the northwest in the Porcupine and Pasquia Hills areas of east-central Saskatchewan (McNeil and Caldwell, 1981). The Ashville correlates westward with the Colorado Group (below the Second (lower) White-speckled shale marker) in Saskatchewan and eastern Alberta, including the Joli Fou and Viking Formations, and an overlying shale unit (Big River Formation of Simpson, 1975) equivalent to the Westgate and Belle Fourche members. Southward the Ashville correlates with the Skull Creek Shale, Newcastle Sandstone, Mowry Shale and Belle Fourche Shale in North Dakota, eastern Montana and Wyoming, and western South Dakota.  History: The 'Ashville beds' were originally defined by Kirk. Wickenden (1945) later recognized them as a formation. Price (1963) applied the name Ashville Group in areas of southeastern Saskatchewan, where subdivisions of the Ashville succession were recognized as formations. An informal division of the Ashville was introduced by Rudkin (1964) and Williams and Burk (1964), consisting of a lower and an upper Ashville separated by the base of the Fish-scale marker beds. McNeil and Caldwell (1981) established a four member division of the Ashville Formation comprising, in ascending order, the Skull Creek Shale, Newcastle Sandstone, Westgate and Belle Fourche Shale members.",Manitoba Saskatchewan,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/000000/GSCC00053000506.html,21
30155,Labiche,late Albian - Santonian,formal; currently in use,"Lithology: Dark grey and brown shales associated with calcareous, white speckled shale, incorporating flakes of coccolithic debris near the top of the unit. The shales are darker, more siliceous and noncalcareous in the lower part of the succession, which also contains thin layers of fish-skeletal debris. Subordinate lithologies are accumulations of calcarenite, composed mainly of Inoceramus prisms, and concretionary pyrite bodies.  Distribution: In exposures along the Athabasca River and tributaries south of Twp. 69, only the upper 122 m (400 ft) of the Labiche Formation are seen. The total thickness, penetrated in wells in Twp. 66, Rge. 24W4M, is about 420 m (1,378 ft).

Relationship: The Labiche Formation makes gradational, conformable contact with the underlying sandstones of the Pelican Formation. It is overlain by sandstones of the Belly River Formation. The unit is correlated with the interval from the top of the Viking Formation to the base of the Foremost Formation in southern Alberta, which includes the First and Second White Speckled Shale units and the Fish Scale Sandstone as important marker sequences, and the Lea Park Formation.

30240,Kallio,Precambrian,"formal, currently in use","Distribution: The rocks of the Mistassini group group lie within the basin partially occupied by Lake Mistassini and Lake Albanel. Excellent exposures may be seen on the islands and shores of both lakes in low-lying cuestas and between the east shore of Lake Albanel and the Temiscamie River (Quirke et al., 1960).
Lithology: The Kallio formation consists of argillite, slate and graywacke. In thin section angular grains of quartz may make up as much as 80 percent of the rock. Plagioclase grains may also occur. Graphite, either with or without fine-grained pyrite, is ubiquitous, and along with mica, is a main constituent of the groundmass. In the slaty facies of the formation, graphite may make a thin section entirely opaque (Quirke et al., 1960).
Relationship: The Kallio formation is a unit of the Mistassini group. The Kallio formation is probably transitional with the underlying upper sideritic chert member of the Temiscamie iron-formation. No rocks have been found stratigraphically above the Kallio formation; thus it is believed to be the youngest consolidated sedimentary rock in the area. The Coom Lake intrusions are clearly younger than the Kallio formation, cutting across the bedding of the slates (Quirke et al., 1960).",Quebec,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/007000/GSCC00053007311.html,21

30592,Cementstone,Early Mississippian Epoch-Mid Mississippian Epoch,Current name,"Dolomitic limestone, mudstone and sandstone. Stratified bedrock. Occurs offshore. Deposited during the Courceyan Substage - to - Chadian Substage (Carboniferous Period) (358.9-344.5 Ma BP). The Cementstone Formation consists of sandstones and shaly mudstones with thin beds of dolomite and dolomitic limestone. The sandstones are grey or white, and in well 44/2-1 are thinly bedded and mainly fine grained. However, they are very fine to medium, or occasionally coarse grained, and moderately or poorly sorted in well 43/2-1, where they form beds up to 25 m thick that are commonly cemented by calcite. Most sandstone beds display blocky log motifs, but some form upward-fining units. The mudstones are silty, yellowish brown, reddish brown or grey, and non-calcareous. Dark grey, carbonaceous and pyritic mudstone beds have also been reported from well 43/2-1. The dolomites are microcrystalline or, locally, cryptocrystalline and are brown, brownish grey or grey, and commonly argillaceous. They are responsible for the spiky velocity log signature that characterizes the Cementstone Formation in well 44/2-1. In well 43/2-1, the spiky signature is muted because there are fewer dolomite beds. <br /><br />Cyclicity of facies, which characterizes the Cementstone Group on the Berwickshire coast (Smith 1967), is also apparent in well 43/2-1. 183 m thick in well 44/2-1, and at least 390 m thick in well 43/2-1. Offshore, the base of the Cementstone Formation has been penetrated only in well 44/2-1, where it is defined by the velocity-log spike corresponding to the lowest Cementstone bed. In north-east England, the base of the Cementstone Group occurs within a gradual transition from terrestrial red-bed facies to mixed lacustrine/quasi-marine and fluvial sediments (George et al. 1976). The top of the Cementstone Formation in well 43/2-1 is defined by a downward change from massive sandstones of the Fell Sandstone Formation to more thinly bedded sandstones, dolomites and mudstones. It is marked by a sharp downward increase in gamma-ray response. The facies change is more gradational in well 44/2-1, where the boundary is placed along the top of the uppermost Cementstone bed and sonic-log spike. In onshore sections, the boundary with the Fell Sandstone is associated with a downward change from mica-free to micaceous sandstone (Smith 1967); this feature may help locate the Fell Sandstone / Cementstone formation boundary offshore in relatively sandy sections that lack significant cementstone development.","The Cementstone Formation may be continuous from the Northumberland coast across western crestal areas of the Mid North Sea High, and along its southeastern flank to the median line. The southern limit of the formation cannot be defined offshore because there are no well penetrations of Dinantian strata in the central Southern North Sea area.

30736,Louise,Callovian Age,Current name,"Sandstone with subsidiary mudstone. Stratified bedrock. Occurs offshore. Deposited during the Callovian Age (Jurassic Period) (166.1-163.5 Ma BP). The member comprises sandstones with minor interbedded mudstones normally stacked in upward-coarsening units (although thin upward-fining units are known).  In the Beatrice Field area, at least four upward-coarsening cycles can be identified.  Upward gradation is normally dark grey, carbonaceous, micaceous and pyritic mudstone with local shell debris to grey and brown, fine-grained, flaser bedded and ripple laminated, silty sandstones with bioturbated bases.  The sandstones are overlain by fine- to medium-grained, cross-bedded or parallel-laminated, locally oolitic, sandstones with bivalves and belemnites.  Calcite and limonite cement occurs throughout.  Bivalves, shell debris, and Rhaxella spicules occur throughout, except in the basal part. See Linsey et al. (1980), Maclennan & Trewin (1989), Stephen et al. (1993) and Stevens (1991). Up to 25 m. The base is defined by the down-section change from sandstones to a thin unit of coal bearing mudstone (Brora Coal Formation).  It is marked by two low-velocity spikes on wireline logs.  In some sections sandstones rest on a coal seam (equivalent to the onshore Brora Coal).  In the eastern part of the member's distribution, sandstones of the Louise Member rest on Lady's Walk Member, Mains Formation, Golspie Formation and Lossiehead Formation.

Deposited during the Paleocene Epoch - to - Eocene Epoch (Palaeogene Period) (66-33.9 Ma BP). The Sele Formation is characterized by medium to dark grey, carbonaceous, pyritic, fissile mudstone, commonly with fine-scale colour lamination. Locally, the mudstone is pale grey, siliceous and blocky, though still finely laminated. Sporadic, thin, altered tuff layers are present, especially in the lower and upper parts. Sandstone units are developed at various levels within the mudstone succession. These are fine to coarse grained and are sharply differentiated from the associated mudstones. The thicker and more continuous sandstone units are given formal member status within the Sele Formation. Where the mudstone facies is dominant, thicknesses are typically in the range 30 to 50 m, increasing to over 200 m where the Forties Sandstone is most fully developed. Where the Sele Formation overlies the Lista Formation, the boundary is normally defined by a downward change from dark grey, fissile mudstone to the grey-green and green-grey, blocky, bioturbated claystones of the Lista Formation. This is commonly associated with a downward decrease in gamma-ray values and by a downward change from well-oriented to scattered dips. The sonic response varies from area to area, though the base of the formation commonly lies at or shortly below a downward decrease in velocity. Where the lower part of the Sele Formation is sandy, the characteristic downward change in log signature may not be displayed (e.g. 22/6-1). In many mudstone-dominated sections, a high-gamma peak is present near the base, e.g. 29/6a-1, and marks a downward change from fissile, well-laminated mudstone to somewhat less fissile, poorly laminated mudstone. Over much of the North Sea Basin, the lower mudstone unit is less than 10 m thick, and where its identification is hampered by poor sample control or a lack of clear wireline-log signatures, the base of the high-gamma spike may provide the most practicable pick for the base of the formation (e.g. 30/24-6). Where the Balder Formation is present, the top of the Sele Formation is marked by a rapid downward decrease in the proportion of tuff layers, represented by a marked downward increase in gamma-ray values. A progressive downward decrease in velocity also occurs across the boundary, but the sharpest change normally occurs a few metres below the gamma marker, reflecting the downward continuation of pale to medium grey silica-cemented mudstone into the uppermost part of the Sele Formation. Where the Balder Formation is absent, as in parts of Quadrant 21 (e.g. 21/25-6), the top of the Sele Formation is taken at a marked downhole incoming of grey, carbonaceous, fissile mudstone.",The Sele Formation is present throughout the basinal areas of the Central and Northern North Sea but passes westwards into the siltstones and sandstones of the Dornoch Formation.

31945,Bowland Shale,Mid Mississippian Epoch-Bashkirian Age,Current name,"Mudstone with subsidiary dolomitic limestone, limestone and sandstone. Stratified bedrock. Occurs both onshore and offshore. Deposited during the Asbian Substage - to - Yeadonian Substage (Carboniferous Period) (337-319 Ma BP). Mainly dark grey fissile and blocky mudstone, weakly calcareous, with subordinate sequences of interbedded limestone and sandstone, fossiliferous in more-or-less discrete bands. <br /><br />Furness and Settle areas: thick-bedded, blocky to sub-fissile, dark grey and black, organic-rich mudstone, with subordinate beds of dark grey siltstone, sandstone and pale brown dolomitic limestone. Marine bands are also present. Shows an upwards decrease in carbonate turbidites and a concomitant increase in siliciclastic sandstone turbidites. <br /><br />South Isle of Man: Black claystone with localized deposition of carbonate turbidites, debris flows, olistoliths, volcaniclastic deposits and lavas. At the base of the formation, the Scarlett Point Member comprises cherty and pyritous tabular beds of pale wackestone and lime-mudstone (dolomitized in places), which display gradational boundaries with interbedded black, fissile, blocky claystone. The limestone is burrowed and has inadunate crinoidal lags and scattered ammonoids. At the top of the formation, the Scarlett Volcanic Member is dominated by a series of volcaniclastic debris flows and gravity slides. Claystone rafts and megaclasts are entrained within the volcaniclastic rocks, and carbonate olistoliths and pillow lavas also occur. Between the members, where the formation oversteps the Balladoole Formation (Great Scar Limestone Group), coarse-grained detrital carbonates and debris beds are common. These include erosively based, graded packstone beds, conglomerate, megaclasts and large olistoliths (with reef limestone and ammonoid faunas) derived from the Balladoole Formation. The middle part of the exposed formation comprises black, calcareous, platy claystone with subordinate beds (up to 2 m thick) of dark wackestone, and dark detrital packstone debris. <br /><br />North Isle of Man: Siltstone, claystone and ironstone dominate, but includes two marine bands and five palaeosols. <br /><br />The bulk of the formation displays uniformly high gamma-ray values, typically exceeding 100 API units. However, superimposed on this are sporadic intervals with very high gamma-ray values which, in well 48/3-3, were shown by Leeder et al. (1990) to represent uranium-rich marine bands. The formation displays occasional high-velocity spikes that may correspond to beds of siltstone or of highly calcareous mudstone. Generally between 120 m and 620 m. The formation thickens northeastwards along the axis of the Central Lancashire High, from about 22 m in the Roddlesworth Borehole (SD62SE/6), 68 m thick in the Holme Chapel Borehole (SD82NE/68), and 102 m in the Boulsworth Borehole (SD93SW/14). The underlying Trawden Limestone Group shows a thinning in the same direction (Evans and Kirby, 1999), suggesting the thickening of the Bowland Shale Formation reflects available accommodation space. <br /><br />In the Craven Reef Belt the Bowland Shale Formation is perhaps 30 m to 200 m thick (see Arthurton et al., 1988, figure 22). <br /><br />In south Cumbria, the Roosecote Borehole proved the formation to be 130 m thick (see Johnson et al., 2001; Rose and Dunham, 1977). <br /><br />On the Isle of Man, the Bowland Shale Formation might be at least 186 m thick. In the north Isle of Man, the Shellag Point Borehole [NX 4565 9965] proved only a part of the formation, reaching 27.55 m in thickness. The conformable base upon the Pendleside Limestone Formation in the Craven Basin, on the Widmerpool Formation in the East Midlands, and the Pentre Chert and Cefn-y-Fedw Sandstone Formation in North Wales, on the Hodderense Limestone Formation in the south of the Isle of Man, is taken at the first appearance of black mudstone above variegated mudstones or fine-grained limestones. <br /><br />In south Cumbria the lower boundary of the formation is taken at the base of the Cravenoceras leion Marine Band, where the dark grey to black marine mudstone rests upon thinly interbedded limestones, mudstones and subordinate sandstones of the Alston Formation. <br /><br />The Bowland Shale Formation onlaps onto and eventually, by Pendleian times, extends over the carbonates of the Central Lancashire High (Trawden Limestone Group). <br /><br />In the Craven Reef Belt, in the Malham Cove/Gordale Scar area, the fissile mudstones with nodules and thin beds of ironstone and limestone of the Bowland Shale Formation, rest unconformably and diachronously on the Malham Formation (Great Scar Limestone Group), or Yoredale Group. <br /><br />In well 41/24a-2, the base of the Bowland Shale Formation is marked by a sharp downhole increase in velocity and decrease in gamma-ray response, corresponding to the top of the highest limestone bed of the Yoredale Formation. The base of the formation has not been penetrated in other North Sea wells. The top of the formation is taken at the base of the Millstone Grit Group over most of the Pennine Basin and at the base of the Morridge Formation in Staffordshire and the East Midlands. The formation shows complex intertongueing with the Morridge and Cefn-y-Fedw Sandstone formations. It is seen as a conformable boundary defined by the base of the lowermost thick feldspathic sandstone of the Millstone Grit Group, or quartzitic sandstone of the Morridge and Cefn-y-Fedw formations, above thick dark grey mudstone of the Bowland Shale Formation. <br /><br />The transition is abrupt in wells 48/3-3 and 48/23-3, although occasional sandstone stringers do occur below the boundary. In well 41/24a-2, the lithofacies transition is gradational, but the boundary is marked by a sharp downhole decrease in velocity.","Widespread in the Craven Basin, including the Lancaster, Garstang, Settle, Clitheroe and Harrogate districts, south Cumbria and the Isle of Man; also in North Wales, Staffordshire and the East Midlands. <br /><br />As few offshore wells have been drilled to sufficient depths to penetrate early Namurian sediments, the distribution of the Bowland Shale Formation is poorly constrained. Basinal mudstones are only 47 m thick in well 41/24a-2. Wells 48/3-3 and 48/23-3 terminated after drilling 217 m and 277 m of basinal mudstones respectively, but the Bowland Shale Formation is likely to be appreciably thicker in areas adjacent to Dinantian growth faults.",http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=BSG,27

Deposited during the Paleocene Epoch - to - Eocene Epoch (Palaeogene Period) (66-33.9 Ma BP). The Dornoch Formation consists of sandstone, siltstone and silty mudstone, with subordinate lignite and claystone in the uppermost part (Beauly Member). The sandstones range from fine to very coarse grade, with local conglomeratic beds, and are generally poorly consolidated. In parts of the Northern North Sea (e.g. block 3/1), the topmost bed of the formation is conglomeratic (Mudge & Copestake 1992). The siltstones and mudstones are brown-grey to grey-brown, micaceous, carbonaceous, and pyritic. They are poorly consolidated and display little or no fissility. Tuffaceous mudstones have been reported from some sections. Reaches over 600 m in the Outer Moray Firth; East Shetland Platform 200-300 m. The Dornoch Formation generally rests directly on mudstone of the Lista Formation, in which case it is marked by a change from grey, carbonaceous, silty, commonly fissile mudstone to to green-grey or olive-grey, poorly bedded mudstone with abundant agglutinating foraminifera. The associated changes in wireline-log character are somewhat variable, depending on whether the base of the Dornoch Formation is represented by sandstone (e.g. 14/25-1, 21/1-6) or mudstone (e.g. 3/8a-5A, 9/18a-4). However, the lower boundary usually occurs at, or shortly below, a marked downward decrease in sonic velocity. The Dornoch Formation is variously overlain by grey mudstones of the Sele Formation (e.g. 3/8a-5A, 9/18a-4), grey, silty, tuffaceous mudstones of the Balder Formation (e.g. 14/25-1), or green-grey, silty, glauconitic mudstones of the Mousa Formation or the Horda Formation (e.g. 21/1-6). The boundary is marked by a downward decrease in gamma-ray values, corresponding to a downward change from mudstone to sandstone, siltstone, or lignite. A marked increase in velocity commonly occurs at, or close to, the boundary, but where lignitic beds occur at the top of the formation (e.g. 14/19-5), there is a marked downward decrease in velocity.","The Dornoch Formation is present over western parts of the Outer Moray Firth and over much of the East Shetland Platform, extending into the Beryl Embayment and the East Shetland Platform.",http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=DORN,27

The Montrose Group is characterized by mudstones that are variable in character but that differ from those of the overlying Moray Group in containing an abundant microfauna and in being poorly bedded, non-pyritic and mostly non-carbonaceous. The mudstones of the Maureen Formation display a downward increase in the proportion of carbonate, culminating in chalky marls that grade downwards into the chalky limestones of the Ekofisk Formation. The sandstones of the Montrose Group were deposited as submarine fans (Parker 1975, Knox et al. 1981; Rochow 1981; Mudge and Bliss 1983; Stewart 1987).

The base of the Maureen Formation is taken at the upward change from chalky limestone or marl of the Chalk Group or Shetland Group to a more variable succession of thinly interbedded marl and limestone with local sandstone. The upper boundary is marked by a downward change from grey to grey-brown, carbonaceous, pyritic, mudstones and siltstones of the Moray Group to greenish, non-pyritic mudstones with abundant microfauna of the Montrose Group.",The Montrose Group extends throughout the North Sea area (Knox & Holloway 1992; Lott & Knox 1994).,http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=MONT,27
33738,Lista,Paleocene Epoch,Current name,"Stratified bedrock. Occurs offshore. Deposited during the Paleocene Epoch (Palaeogene Period) (66-56 Ma BP). The mudstone facies of the Lista Formation is characterized by non-calcareous, blocky, bioturbated, non-carbonaceous and non-pyritic mudstone. In deeper parts of the basin the mudstone is extremely fine grained, grading to true claystone, often with irregular, listric fracture surfaces. The dominant colour is pale green-grey to grey-green, with subordinate pale yellowish grey, red-grey, red-brown and dark grey. Much of the mudstone is unbedded, especially in the upper part, but moderately fissile and commonly darker mudstone or claystone occurs in the basal part of the unit. The degree of fissility is directly related to the intensity of bioturbation, with the mudstones in the middle and upper parts of the formation commonly being totally homogenized. <i>Zoophycos</i> burrows, preserved as thin inclined layers with distinctive chevron markings in cross-section, are commonly observed in cores. The mudstone is generally non-calcareous, but is locally highly calcareous in the south Central Graben. Siderite is commonly present as concretions. Calcareous mudstone is encountered in southern parts of the Central Graben, apparently reflecting the incorporation of disseminated chalk reworked from the Cretaceous or early Paleocene. <br /><br />The associated sandstones are variable in character. They mostly range from fine to medium grade and display varying degrees of cementation. Conglomeratic sandstones are present at some levels, especially in the Central Graben, with the coarse fraction being composed exclusively of fragments of chalk or penecontemporaneous mudstone. Sandstone lithologies are discussed in more detail below (refer to Heimdal Sandstone Member, Mey Sandstone Member). <br /><br />Thin, argillized, primary air-fall tuff layers are present in the lower part of the formation. Sand-grade, green to brown reworked ash is a prominent feature of the Mey Sandstone Member in parts of the Outer Moray Firth area, where it occurs as discrete volcaniclastic units (Balmoral Tuffite, e.g. 14/25-1) or disseminated in tuffaceous sandstones (refer to Mey Sandstone Member). The Lista Formation reaches over 600 m in the Outer Moray Firth area (e.g. 15/18-2), where the Mey Sandstone Member is thickest. In mudstone facies, the lower boundary of the Lista Formation is marked by a downhole change from varicoloured, commonly waxy mudstone or claystone to grey, silty, carbonaceous mudstone of the Maureen Formation (unit 2). This boundary commonly corresponds to the base of a small gamma-ray peak, below which gamma-ray values decrease progressively (e.g. 16/18-1, 14/25-1, 29/8b-1) or sharply (e.g. 3/8a-5A). The boundary is also associated with a zone of relatively low mudstone velocity; this helps to identify the boundary where more than one gamma-ray peak is present. In parts of the southern and western Central Graben, mudstone of the Lista Formation appears to rest directly on a unit of reworked chalk (e.g. 21/8-1), in which case the characteristic gamma-ray peak is not displayed. In mudstone facies, the top of the Lista Formation is recognized by a downhole change from dark grey, carbonaceous and commonly laminated mudstone of the Moray Group to paler, often greenish, poorly laminated mudstone. This change is accompanied by a marked increase in abundance of agglutinating foraminifera, recognizable in cuttings as minute sandy aggregates, often in tubular form (<i>Bathysiphon</i>). On wireline logs the boundary between Moray Group and Lista Formation mudstones is marked by a downhole decrease in gamma values (e.g. 16/18-1, 29/8b-1). Where sandstone is present at the base of the Moray Group (e.g. 14/25-1) there is no characteristic log signature to identify this boundary. The top of the Lista Formation is in mudstone facies over most of the region, but locally sandstone is present at or very near the top (e.g. 15/24-1; 22/2-2). In such cases, it may be difficult to determine whether the sandstone belongs to the Lista Formation or to the overlying Moray Group unless core samples or biostratigraphic data are available.","The Lista Formation occurs throughout the basinal area of the Central and Northern North Sea, with its western margin being erosional. Lott & Knox (1994) extended the geographical range of the Lista Formation to include the Southern North Sea.",http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=LIST,27
33746,Moray,Paleocene Epoch-Eocene Epoch,Current name,"Stratified bedrock. Occurs offshore. Deposited during the Paleocene Epoch - to - Eocene Epoch (Palaeogene Period) (66-33.9 Ma BP). The Moray Group is characterized by grey to grey-brown, carbonaceous, pyritic mudstones and siltstones that contrast with the greenish mudstones of the overlying Stronsay Group and the underlying Montrose Group. The group is also characterized by a relatively sharp transition between a 'shelf' succession dominated by sandstone and siltstone, with subordinate lignite, and a 'basinal' succession dominated by mudstone. The shelf succession is assigned to the Dornoch Formation and the basinal succession to the Sele Formation and the Balder Formation. The Moray Group reaches thicknesses of over 500 m in Outer Moray Firth Basin thinning to less than 30 m in the southern Central North Sea. The base of the Moray Group is marked by a downward change from grey to grey-brown, carbonaceous, pyritic mudstones and siltstones to greenish mudstones of the Montrose Group. The top of the Moray Group is marked by a downward change from greenish mudstones of the Stronsay Group to grey to grey-brown, carbonaceous pyritic mudstones and siltstones.",The Moray Group extends throughout the UK North Sea area (Knox & Holloway 1992; Lott & Knox 1994).

33750,Balder,Eocene Epoch,Current name,"Mudstone, sandstone and tuff. Stratified bedrock. Occurs offshore. Deposited during the Eocene Epoch (Palaeogene Period) (56-33.9 Ma BP). The Balder Formation consists of light to dark grey, generally fisile, carbonaceous, pyritic mudstone with abundant tuff layers in the lowest part. The mudstone is well laminated in the lower part, with light to medium grey indurated siliceous mudstone alternating with medium to dark grey soft, fissile mudstone. In the upper part, the mudstone is fissile, but soft and poorly laminated. In parts of the Viking Graben, the tuff-rich mudstones include thin reddish grey layers, often with diffuse boundaries, and often associated with minor bioturbation.<br /><br />The tuffs mostly occur as thin layers up to a few centimetres in thickness, with sharp bases and commonly displaying normal size grading; these are interpreted as undisturbed air-fall tuffs. Several cored sections in the Viking Graben have revealed units several tens of centimeteres thick that are internally structureless or display dewatering structures; such units are interpreted as resulting from grvity-flow resedimentation of the primary air-fall tuff (Malm et al. 1984). Sporadic calcite-cemented concretions or concretionary beds are present in some sections, as indicated by high-velocity spikes (e.g. 9/18a-15).<br /><br />Sandstone units up to 200 m thick occur in the Balder Formation in central and northern parts of the Viking Graben; thinner sandstone units occur in southwestern parts of the Central Graben (principally Quadrant 29). The sandstones are typically well sorted, clean and poorly cemented, although tightly cemented sandstones occur locally. In the Viking Graben, some sandstones in the upper part of the formation are believed to have been emplaced by injection from lower levels. The sandstone units in 204/9-1 and 205/16-1 may be informally referred to as the 'Balder Sandstone'. Typically 30 to 50 m thick; 100 m in Outer Moray Firth, 300 m+ in the South Viking. Typically 50-150 m on the UK NW Margin. The base of the Balder Formation is taken at a sharp downward decrease in the thickness of tuff layers and in the proportion of tuff to laminated mudstone. It is marked on wireline logs by a sharp downward increase in gamma-ray values; a downward decrease in sonic velocity typically takes place a few metres below (e.g. 21/10-1). A blocky log response is displayed where sandstone is present in the lower part of the formation, as in parts of the South Viking Graben (e.g. 9/18a-15; 9/19-7Z). Where the Balder Formation rests directly on the Dornoch Formation (e.g. 14/25-1) it is represented by variably tuffaceous siltstone or mudstone, generally resting on low-gamma sandstone or lignite. The top of the Balder Formation is normally defined by a downward change from grey-green or variegated mudstones of the Horda Formation, or from green-grey glauconitic siltstones of the basal Mousa Formation, to medium to dark grey, pyritic mudstone. In the south of Quadrants 21 and 22, the Balder Formation is locally overlain by sandstones of the Tay Formation.<br /><br />In basinal sections, the top of the Balder Formation is taken at the base of a sharp high-gamma peak (e.g. 21/10-1), which is believed to represent a phosphate-rich condensed section at the base of the Horda Formation. The upper part of the Balder Formation often displays low resistivity values, and a marked downward decrease in resistivity values commonly serves to identify the top of the formation in sections where the gamma peak is poorly developed or absent (e.g. 15/28-2).","The Balder Formation is present throughout most of the Central and Northern North Sea. It is, however, absent from most sections in the Outer Moray Firth, where the Mousa Formation rests directly on the Dornoch Formation. It is also locally absent along the southwestern margin of the Central Graben (e.g. 21/18-1A, 21/25-6), as a result of erosion before or during deposition of the Tay Sandstone.

Deposited during the Albian Age (Cretaceous Period) (113-100.5 Ma BP). The typical lithology of the Carstone Formation is a greenish-brown (rusty when weathered), thick-bedded, cross-bedded, oolitic ferruginous sandstone.  The formation is medium- to coarse-grained and pebbly in part, especially at the base where it becomes a conglomerate. Pebbles comprising quartz, quartzite, pyritised sandstone, ironstone, grey siltstone and rolled ammonites. Some beds are silty and/ or contain clay wisps. Glauconite may be present in variable amounts. The Carstone Formation is burrowed in places with common Arenicolites and Skolithus. Generally up to about 5m, but it reaches its maximum thickness, of 18.9m, in the Hunstanton Borehole. The Carstone Formation, which was deposited during a phase of unconformable transgression, oversteps many different lithostratigraphical units. Its base is erosional and locally burrowed into the underlying strata.  The base can be recognized by a downward change from greenish-brown, thick-bedded, cross-bedded, commonly bioturbated, oolitic, ferruginous, medium- to coarse-grained and pebbly sandstone on (from south to north): Palaeozoic sequences on the London Platform (e.g. Four Ashes Borehole); quartz sands and  thin mudstone (Dersington Formation);  buff and grey, clayey ferruginous sands and quartz sands (Sandringham Sands Formation) in central Norfolk, between Leziate and West Dereham;  pale and medium clays (Kimmeridge Clay Formation) in central Norfolk (Mudford-Great Ellingham); pale-medium grey, very fine- to fine-grained, bioturbated, shelly sandstones with phosphatic nodules (Roach Formation) in Northern Norfolk;  Shelly, calcareous mudstone (Sutterby Marl) in southern Lincolnshire;  Ironstone (Fulletby Formation) in central Lincolnshire;  Dark, glauconitic mudstones and limestones (Tealby Formation) in northern Lincolnshire; brown, shelly oolitic ironstone (Claxby Ironstone Formation); late Jurassic mudstones (Kimmeridge Clay and Ampthill Clay formations) and coarse-grained sandstone (Elsham Sandstone Member) at the Humber Estuary; pale to medium, fine- to medium-grained sandstones and dark mudstones (Kellaways Formation) in southern Yorkshire;  Upper Lias mudstones on the south side of the Market Weighton High. In southern and central Norfolk the upper boundary is defined by an up-section transition from greenish-brown, massive, cross-bedded, bioturbated, oolitic ferruginous sandstone to pale to medium grey mudstones and siltstones (Gault Formation). In northern Norfolk and Lincolnshire the boundary is marked by a sharp, perhaps gradational, up-section change from greenish-brown, massive cross-bedded, bioturbated, oolitic, ferruginous sandstone into red, pink or cream limestones and marls (Hunstanton Chalk Formation).","The southern limit of the formation is between Duxford and Soham, Cambridgeshire, and southeast of the Four Ashes Borehole (TM07SW1 [TM 02230 71860]) on the London Platform High, although it is not seen at outcrop in these areas. The Carstone extends northwards through Norfolk and its best exposure is in the cliffs and foreshore at Hunstanton.

Predominantly comprises black commonly pyritic mudstones, siliceous mudstones, bedded cherts and some thin limestones. Formations dominated by limestone or sandstone turbidites are locally developed. Shallower water formations comprising greenish mudstones with thin limestones and black mudstones with quartzitic sandstones are confined to north Cornwall. Scattered formations and units of basaltic tuff and lava locally are present on the south crop of the group. 100 to 720m On the north crop in north Devon and west Somerset, the lower boundary is taken at the incoming of black, locally siliceous mudstones of the Teign Valley Group (Doddiscombe Mudstone Formation) above the soft mid to dark grey mudstones with scattered very thin fossiliferous limestones, siltstones and sandstones of the underlying Exmoor Group (Pilton Mudstone Formation). On the south crop in south Devon, the lower boundary is taken at the incoming of black, locally siliceous mudstones of the Teign Valley Group (Combe Mudstone Formation) above the olive green and pale grey mudstones of the Trusham Mudstone Formation. Elsewhere on the south crop the base is thrust out.

The formation comprises a number of heavily bioturbated coarsening-upward units each comprising dark grey sandy muds or muddy sands passing up into fine- to medium-grained grey to green glauconitic sands. Weak cementation occurs at the top of many of the units producing discontinuous calcareous, phosphatic or pyritic concretions that are generally fossiliferous. The middle of the formation contains plant debris. Eleven units (IV to XV) described as 'members' are informally identified within the succession. Full lithological descriptions for each of these informal members are given in Insole et al. (1998, pp. 65-68). The succession at Chale Bay is divided into eleven units considered to be of member status in Insole et al. (1998) and whose numbering follows on from the members as defined by Fitton (1847, 'Groups' I, II and III) of the preceding Atherfield Clay Formation. The 'members' of Insole et al. (1998) are difficult to recognise and trace laterally away from the type site of Chale Bay and must therefore be regarded as informal terms. The 'members', in ascending order, are Member IV, Member V, Member VI, Whale Chine Member, Member VIII, Ladder Chine Member, Member X, Member XI, Old Walpen Chine Member, New Walpen Chine Member, Member XIV and Member XV. Up to about 161m. The lower boundary is marked by a short transition from silty clays of the Upper Atherfield Clay Formation (the Upper Lobster Member) up into ferruginous sands and sandstones with concretions. The upper boundary has been defined in a number of ways. Fitton (1847) and Casey (1961) placed the boundary at the top of their 'Group XV' (equivalent to Member XV), where coarsening-upward estuarine silty mudstones pass up into interlaminated black clays and white sands (of their Ferruginous Sands) and are overlain by the white, quartzose sands of the Sandrock Formation. This boundary (Fitton, 1847; Casey, 1961) is a scoured erosion surface separating the estuarine mudstones from marine sandstones with a highly burrowed and indurated top. It marks a sequence boundary and is the current definition of the base of the succeeding unit (Sandrock Formation) (Insole et al., 1998; Ruffell and Wach, 1998). Wach and Ruffell (1990) placed the boundary within Member XV where the estuarine silty mudstone passes up into the interlaminated black clays and white sands. They regarded this unit as a transitional bed of estuarine mudstone passing up into the estuarine sands of the Sandrock Formation.

It was divided by Lamplugh (1889), into five units (E to A from the base up) related to belemnite content, and these divisions are still maintained.E Bed: The basal bed comprises mainly phosphatic nodules with scattered rolled and fragmented, pyritised and phosphatised bivalves, ammonites and bone, and is usually referred to as the Coprolite Bed (Lamplugh, 1923). There is a marked break in the succession at the base of this bed and a less obvious one at its top. D Beds: Black shale is overlain by greenish-brown, brown and grey clays and includes the Blue Bed (D6), the Ligula Bed (D5), the Astarte Bed (D4) and the D3 Bed (un-named). A compound nodular bed (Bed D1) occurs at the top of the 'D beds'. A significant break in the succession occurs between Beds D2D and D2E. These beds are also historically known  as the Lateralis Beds (Lamplugh, 1923). C Beds: Alternations of pale and dark grey clays and shaley clays are characteristic of these beds. Nodules and glauconite occur at some levels. Includes the Main Speetonensis Bed (C6) and the Echinospatangus Bed (C3). Historically known also as the Jaculum Beds (Lamplugh, 1923). B Beds: A lower part of pale and dark grey and blue-grey clays with nodules and pyritous at some horizons passes upwards into the 'Cement Beds' and into an upper succession of striped blue, black and grey clays with nodules. Historically known also as the Brunsvicensis Beds (Lamplugh, 1923).

It is usually marked by a thin bed of well-rounded flint gravel or a glauconitic horizon, or both, typically resting on a sharply defined planar surface, although locally uneven. The London Clay Formation overlies the Harwich Formation or, where the Harwich Formation is absent, the Lambeth Group. The top of the London Clay Formation is taken as the top of the Claygate Member, which is distinguished from the overlying Bagshot Formation by containing finer sand without cross-bedding and in the relative abundance of clay and silt in the Claygate Member.","The London Clay occurs in the London Basin, East Anglia and the Hampshire Basin.",http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=LC,27
35173,Gault,Albian Age,Current name,"Clay and mudstone with subsidiary calcareous mudstone, limestone, sand and silty mudstone. Stratified bedrock. Occurs both onshore and offshore. Deposited during the Albian Age (Cretaceous Period) (113-100.5 Ma BP). Pale to dark grey or blue-grey clay or mudstone, glauconitic in part, with a sandy base. Discrete bands of phosphatic nodules (commonly preserving fossils), some pyrite and calcareous nodules. At Munday's Hill, Bedfordshire the base of the Gault Formation is brick-red mudstone called informally the 'Cirripede Bed'. In Norfolk, the Gault Formation becomes calcareous before passing northwards into the Hunstanton Formation ('Red Chalk'). In places thin, variable junction beds at the base include some limestones. About 2m in north Norfolk, thickening southwards to 20m in Cambridgeshire, 60m in Bedfordshire, and 90 to 110m in the Weald (104m in the Glyndebourne Borehole TQ41SW/16 [TQ4420 1141]). The base is an unconformity. There is a rapid transition from sands of the Lower Greensand Group and equivalents where these are present or a marked break where the basal Gault Formation rests on rocks down to Triassic in age. Beneath London the lower part of the Gault Formation is absent or severely attenuated over the London-Brabant Ridge (formed of Palaeozoic rocks). Generally the base of the Gault Formation is taken at the base of a phosphatic pebble bed or gritty mudstone where it overlies the Carstone in East Anglia, the Monk's Bay Sandstone Formation on the Isle of Wight or the Folkestone Formation of the Weald. Elsewhere in southern England the base of the Gault Formation rests on an unconformity and oversteps onto undivided Lower Greensand Group sandstones and ironstone, may overlie attenuated Wealden, and oversteps onto various units of the Jurassic. In the extreme west of the outcrop the overstep places the Gault Formation on Triassic mudstones and sandstones. The top of the formation is a diachronous transition from mudstone into Upper Greensand Formation facies (glauconitic sand) westward of a line from Sevenoaks (Kent) to Lewes (Sussex). In eastern areas the upper boundary of the formation is the unconformable junction with the basal Grey Chalk Subgroup (argillaceous, glauconitic sandstone, chalky sandstone and sandy chalk, with common phosphatic nodules). In Cambridgeshire the mudstones of the Gault Formation are overlain at a sharp erosive junction by the strongly phosphatic sandstone of the Cambridge Greensand Member at the base of the Chalk Group (West Melbury Marly Chalk Formation).","Extensive outcrop in eastern England from Norfolk, southwestwards across the East Midlands and Home Counties to Devon, in the Isle of Wight and around the margins of the the Weald.",http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=GLT,27

Incoherent, moderately clean, pale grey (locally green, yellow or orange), fine- to medium-grained, cross-bedded quartz sands with subordinate bands of silt or clay. Pyrite nodules are present and glauconite is locally abundant. Up to 30m. The base is taken at the up-section change from glauconitic, clayey, grey and green sands with bands and 'doggers' of brown-weathering clay-ironstone and seams of phosphatic nodules (Mintlyn Sands Member) to incoherent, moderately clean, pale grey (locally green, yellow or orange), fine- to medium-grained, cross-bedded quartz sands with subordinate bands of silt or clay (Leziate Member).

Locally the sands of the Leziate Member are overlain by mid to dark grey clay (?Snettisham Clay) (Gallois, 1994). In the Gayton-Marham area, pebbly, ferruginous sandstones (Carstone Formation) overstep the incoherant, moderately clean, pale grey Leziate Member.","The Leziate Member occurs in boreholes in The Wash and in Norfolk, and extends from Heacham southwards to Denver. North of King's Lynn it forms a steep feature capped by the sandstones of the Dersingham Formation, but south of King's Lynn, the feature is subdued beneath the Carstone. The Leziate Member occurs in the heathland areas of Dersingham Heath, Sandringham Warren, Roydon Common, Leziate Heath and Shouldham Warren.

Breccia formed of limestone and dolostone together with sparse clasts of red mudstone filling subvertical karstic fissures in the limestone and dolostones of the Zechstein Group (formerly Magnesian Limestone). Two distinct units occur. The lower 'unfossiliferous fissure fills' are likely to be either Mesozoic or early Palaeogene in age as they are similar to evaporite dissolution breccias that occur elsewhere within the Permian limestones. The upper 'fossiliferous fissure fills' contain clay in addition to limestone debris that has yielded assemblages of partially pyritized organic material including peat, seeds, tree trunks, ostrocods, mammalian bones and freshwater molluscs. The remains of over 100 species of plant have been identified from lower parts. Of this 'Castle Eden Flora' 64% of the species no longer grow in Britain, or are extinct. This flora suggests an Early Pleistocene age, which is supported by the identification of Mammuthus meridionalis, an elephant that was common in Europe in the Early Pleistocene up to the Cromerian.

Five lithofacies have been described: <br /><br />1) Bioturbated, fossiliferous marine mudstones and siltstones with thin, poorly sorted, very fine grained, glauconitic sands at their base. <br /><br />2) Bioturbated, silty, fine-grained sandstones with fragments of bivalves and belemnites. <br /><br />3) Well sorted, massive to cross-bedded, bioturbated, medium-grained sandstones with sporadic shell debris. <br /><br />4) Well sorted, planar to cross-bedded, coarse-grained sandstones. <br /><br />5) Upward fining, very coarse- to coarse-grained, cross-bedded sandstones. <br /><br />Locally, argillaceous and bioturbated sandstones with very high gamma-ray values ('Hot Sands member' of Waddams and Clark, 1991) occur in the upper part of the member. <br /><br />In many wells the lithofacies of the Chanter Sandstone Member are stacked in upward-coarsening cycles (e.g. well 15/16-6) (Turner et al., 1984).  In the type section there are three large scale upward coarsening cycles and two upward fining cycles occur (Richards et al., 1993). <br /><br />The mudstones within the member are commonly dark grey, carbonaceous and micaceous.  In the Ivanhoe and Rob Roy fields, the basal unit comprises organic-rich mudstones with pyritic nodules, passing up into bioturbated mudstones and siltstones grading up into argillaceous sandstones (Parker, 1991). <br /><br />In the Piper Field Maher (1981) and Schmitt and Gordon (1991) recognised seven subunits in the Chanter Sandstone Member, informally designated 'C' to 'I' in descending order. Up to 300 m. The base of the Chanter Sandstone Member, where it rests on the Pibroch Sandstone Member, is placed at the base of a widespread marine mudstone informally known as the 'I Shale' (of Maher, 1981).  Where the Pibroch Sandstone Member is missing, the base is placed either at the base of the Kimmeridgian shallow marine sandstone section, or at the base of a thin unit of Kimmeridge Clay mudstone (the 'I Shale'). The top is commonly defined by the down-section change from mudstones or siltstones to sandstones.  Wireline log signatures often show a transitional change across the boundary, but on structural highs it may be sharp.  The top of the member can be difficult to define from wireline log data.  This is particularly so when the Claymore Sandstone Member overlies the Chanter Sandstone Member (e.g. in well 15/12-1), although in some areas a thin unit of Kimmeridge Clay separates the two.",Central part of the Witch Ground Graben between Halibut Horst and Fladen Ground Spur (within ts 14 and 15).,http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=CHNT,27
36343,Heather,Bathonian Age-Oxfordian Age,Current name,"Mudstone and siltstone with subsidiary sandstone and trace limestone. Stratified bedrock. Occurs offshore. Deposited during the Bathonian Age - to - Oxfordian Age (Jurassic Period) (168.3-157.3 Ma BP). The formation comprises medium to dark grey to brown mudstone and siltstone, predominantly, with sporadic thin sandstone stringers or concretions of pale brown limestone or dolomitic limestone.  The mudstone is usually poorly fissile, soft to firm and moderately calcareous (due to the common calcareous microfossils).  The mudstone is locally carbonaceous and pyritic.  The limestone is generally microcrystalline and hard producing a low gamma and high velocity spikes.  The sandstone stringers are usually friable, fine-grained and quartzose; locally with glauconite and mica.  Thicker sandstone bodies, which are given member status (Bruce, Freshney and Ling sandstone members), are mainly very fine and fine-grained, sometimes micaceous and occasionally calcite cemented.  A spiculitic sandstone occurs in the Inner Moray Firth (Alness Spiculite Member). East Shetland Basin: up to 350 m.  South Viking Graben: up to 600 m.  Central North Sea: up to 700 m. The nature of the lower boundary varies as the formation overlies a number of different units.  It is usually recognised by a downward transition from mudstone and siltstone (Heather Formation) to sandstone or interbedded sandstone, siltstone and coal (Hugin, Tarbert or, in the Inner Moray Firth, Beatrice formations).  The lower boundary is marked by a down-section decrease in gamma and velocity values.  In the Outer Moray Firth and Central Graben the downward transition from mudstone to thinly interbedded sandstone, mudstone and coal (Stroma Member of the Pentland Formation) or red and grey-brown Triassic mudstone (Smith Bank Formation). Mudstone of the Kimmeridge Clay overlies mudstone of the Heather Formation, so that the boundary is difficult to locate lithologically.  It is usually taken at a sharp down-section decrease in gamma values, sometime associated with a decrease in resistivity and increase in velocity.  However, in basinal sections there are a number of geophysical excursions that could be confused with the boundary.  Often there is a down section lightening of the colour of the mudstones at the boundary, a decease in organic content and an increasein the proportion of thin limestone beds.  Locally, the Brae, Fulmar or Piper formations overlie the Heather Formation and in this case the boundary can be recognised by the downward change from sandstone to mudstone.","East Shetland Basin, Viking Graben and Central North Sea.

38505,Grebes Nest Point,Early Ordovician,formal; currently in use,"Age Justification: The black graptolitic shales contain Didymograptus nitidus, which indicate an Arenig age. The oolitic ironstones are rich in trace fossils (e.g., Cruziana), inarticulate brachiopods (e.g., Lingulobulus), trilobites (Neseuretus sp.; Ogyginus) and microplanktonic fossils (e.g., Arbusculidium filamentosum). 

Type Locality: Northwest side of Bell Island, including former submarine mines, Conception Bay, Avalon Peninsula, eastern Newfoundland (NTS 1 N/10, 11).
Distribution: The group is about 106 m thick in surface outcrop, attaining at least 257 m when combined with drillhole data (Ranger et al., 1984). It is exposed on the northwestern side of Bell Island (NTS 1 N/10) where the beds dip 8 deg northwestward under Conception Bay (NTS 1 N/11). Submarine exploration suggests that the Lower Ordovician succession of the Wabana Group occupies a fault bounded, north-northeast trending block with the depocentre 3 km north of Bell Island. Its maximum extent within Conception Bay is shown in Miller (1983, Figure 6).

Lithology: Graptolitic black shale, brown sandstone, minor orthoquartzite, oolitic hematite, and pyrite with phosphatic pebble beds. The group includes, in ascending order, The Powers Steps, Scotia, Grebes Nest Point, Gull Island, and Gravel Head formations. The magnetic properties of the oolitic hematite are discussed in Ozdemir and Deutsch (1984).

Relationship: The base of the Wabana Group is sharp and disconformably overlies the Dominion Formation of the Bell Island Group. The top is not exposed as the group extends under Conception Bay, and its submarine extension beyond the bay is unknown. Regional correlations in the North Atlantic are discussed by Rast et al. (1976), O'Brien et al. (1983), and King and O'Brien (1989).
History: van Ingen (1914) introduced the term Wabana Series for the upper part of the Lower Ordovician section and divided some of it into formations, in ascending order, Pyrite bed, Scotia ore bed, upper ore bed, and Gravel Head. The term Scotia ore bed was used in the original (circa 1893) landclaim of the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Company (Hayes, 1915, pp. 4-5). Rose (1952) replaced ""series"" by ""group"" . Nautiyal (1966) informally relegated the Wabana Group to forma-tional status. Ranger (1979) retained the name Wabana Group and subdivided it into several formations, which coincide in part with van Ingen's (1914) subdivisions. King (1982) and Pickerill and Fillion (1983) informally adapted much of Ranger's (1979) terminology. Ranger et al.

These fossils indicate the Powers Steps is Arenig in age.

Type Locality: Powers Steps, northwestern side of Bell Island, Conception Bay, eastern Newfoundland (47 deg 38'05""N, 52 deg 59'17""W; NTS 1 N/10).
Distribution: The formation is about 70 m thick. It is exposed at Powers Steps, be-tween Youngsters Gulch and Upper Grebes Nest Point, on the northwestern side of Bell Island. An additional large exposure is present between Gull Island North Head and the gravel beach immediately to the east of Grebes Nest Point.

Lithology: The basal 6 m consists of interbedded, silty shale, shale, and thin beds of phosphatic and pyritic, oolitic ironstone containing pyritized graptolites, pyrite-coated shale pebbles, and phosphatic shell fragments. The shale and silty shale also contain thin layers and stringers of pyritic and phosphatic shale pebble conglomerates. The overlying 28 m is fissile, dark, graptolitic shale containing thin, rippled siltstone and sandstone layers and lenses that increase in abundance and thickness upwards. Within the shale are several horizons, along which limey septarian nodules surrounded by cone-in-cone structures are common. In the upper 36 m, silty shale and sandy siltstone gradually replace the fissile shale. These sediments exhibit a variety of sedimentary structures. The sequence is believed to have been deposited initially in shallow subtidal conditions and latterly in an intertidal environment. Included within this formation is the Youngsters Gulch Member.

Relationship: The Powers Steps Formation disconformably overlies the Lower Ordovi-cian Dominion Formation of the Bell Island Group with a sharp contact. The upper boundary is sharp and apparently conformable with the overlying Scotia Formation. The Wabana Group includes, in ascending order, the Powers Steps, Scotia, Grebes Nest Point, Gull Island and Gravel Head formations.

In Nautiyal's (1966) informal classification, the Youngsters Gulch Member was included in the lower member of his Wabana formation and the remainder of the Powers Steps Formation, together with the overlying Scotia Formation, were included in his middle member.

39405,Eastern Island,Proterozoic III - early Paleozoic,informal; currently in use,"Lithology:
This formation is composed of steeply dipping, variably trending, semipeltic schist with psammitic and pelitic schist, greenschist, and minor metafelsite interlayers. The medium grained semipelite is thin to medium layered, weathers gray to buff, and ranges from muscovite-chlorite-quartz-plagioclase to biotite-chlorite-plagioclase schist. The chlorite content increases significantly near greenschist layers. Locally, near the center of Eastern Island, a distinct garnetiferous muscovite-quartz semipelite occurs with fresh garnets up to 5 mm in diameter. Pebbly semipelite is common in the hills on the southeast portion of the island; clasts are commonly of felspar and quartz, generally less than 1 cm in diameter. Other metasedimentary components of the sequence include fine to medium grained, buff psammite and gray-green feldspathic pelite. The psammitic layers are generally less than 70 cm thick and increases in number and thickness toward the contact with the Hit or Miss Point Formation. The pelitic units range up to 15 m wide and are common at the southeastern corner of Eastern Island. Tourmaline occurs locally within all of the metasediments. Greenschist zones, from less than 50 cm up to 300 m wide, occur throughout the metasedimentary sequence. Their contact with the semipelitic schists is gradational in most places. The mafic units are dominantly composed of chlorite, epidote and plagioclase, and locally contain quartz-rich chlorite-epidote layers and garnetiferous grennschist. Knobby weathering epidote-chlorite nodules and rounded amphibole clasts are common in the mafic schists. Aong the north coast of Eastern Island, marble bands up to 10 cm wide are interlayered with thinly (centimetre scale) banded mafic schists; elsewhere, small pods of carbonate are common in these units. In the cove immediately east of the Horse Island community, a black, fine grained, tourmaline-quartz vein, 50 cm wide, crosscuts banding in the mafic schist. A few pink to light green weathering metafelsite layers up to 1 m wide occur within a thin but continuous mafic schist belt along the east coast of Eastern Island. They are quartz-muscovite-epidote schists that contain substantial amounts of sphene and large (up to 3 mm) clost of chlorite that appear to be pseudomorphs of garnet; one small unaltered garnet was noted in the section. The pinkish cast of these rocks is produced by rose colored muscovite. Disseminated pyrite is common within the metafelsite. At one locality, a fine grained, angular epidote-chlorite-plagioclase clast occurs within a metafelsite layers that is bordered on one side by a greenschist band. The general characteristics of the greenschist and metafelsite units and their interlayered nature and gradational contacts with the metasediments suggest a volcanic orgin; the mafic schist may have largely been mafic fragmental rocks, tuff, and epiclastic volcanic sediments, and the metafelsite may have been silicic tuff (Hibbard, 1983b).
Relationship:
The Horse Islands Group (Fleur de Lys Supergroup) is separated into two formations, the Eastern Island Formation and the Hit or Miss Point Formation (Hibbard, 1983b). The Hit or Miss Point Formation is in conformable transitional contact with the Eastern Island Formation on both the north and south coasts of Eastern Island. The stratigraphic sequence of the two units is uncertain due to the structural complexity of the rocks; a few sparsely distributed facing determinations from pebbly psammites in the Hit of Miss Point Formation are south facing, suggesting that the Hit or Miss Point Formaiton may, in part, overlie the Eastern Island Formation. The greenschists of the Eastern Island Formation are strikingly similar to parts of the Birchy Complex on the Baie Verte Peninsula. Rocks of the Eastern Island Formation are intruded by unmetamorphosed diabase dikes (Hibbard and Bursnall, 1979).",Newfoundland & Labrador,http://weblex.nrcan.gc.ca/html/004000/GSCC00053004451.html,21
